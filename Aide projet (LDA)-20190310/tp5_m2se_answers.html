<p>Now it's time to start manipulating the data. First create a variable to store the number of features we want to manipulate (i.e., the size of the vocabulary). Then, build the TF-IDF term-document matrix. For this, apply the <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> with the following parameter values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter out words that appear in more than 50% of the documents</li>
<li>Filter out words that appear in less than 2 documents</li>
<li>Use the idf</li>
<li>Filter out english stop words</li>

<p>Since we have the labels of the documents, it is possible to evaluate the quality of the clustering by checking if it succeeded in grouping documents having the same labels. The package <code>metrics</code> of the <code>scikit</code> library has some interesting features for doing so. Have a look to the documentation and calculate the following quality scores:</p>

<p>As usual, the first step data preprocessing. Here, we will apply the same pretreatment than in the previous section and then build the term-document matrix. However, NMF and LDA do not require the same metric for building the term-document matrix. Indeed, since LDA because is a probabilistic graphical model, it makes no sense to use the TF-IDF. Thus, for LDA, we are using the term frequency (using the <code>CountVectorizer</code> class) to build the matrix whereas we are using the TF-IDF (using the <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> as in the previous section) for NMF. Apply these treatments for the methods accordingly and store the feature name (the 1000 words that are used as columns of the matrices). This can be done with the <code>get_feature_name</code> function applied on the newly created instances of the vectorizer.</p>

<p>We can now apply the two algorithms, <code>NMF</code> and <code>lda</code> by setting the number of components to the number of desired topics and letting the other parameters as their default values (except for <code>lda</code> for which you should specificy <code>learning_method="batch"</code> to avoid a warning). Once the algorithm has been run (i.e., the <code>fit</code> function has been applied), we will store the resulting matrices (that contain information of the words that represent topics as well as wihich topics are included in which documents). To do so, the "document-topic" matrix can be obtained with the <code>transform(tfidf)</code> function (here <code>tfidf</code> is for NMF) of the model. The "topic-word" matrix can be obtained using the <code>components_</code> of the model.</p>

Novosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred
to Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is
Arutunian, my husband&#39;s name . . .

That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints 
and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the 
Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past 
year. I couldn&#39;t find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because 
I, I&#39;ll just say it, couldn&#39;t steal, couldn&#39;t deceive, and couldn&#39;t be 
involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they 
told me, &#34;Leave, don&#39;t keep the others from working, you aren&#39;t cut out for 
this kind of work.&#34; And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at 
the Armenians, like &#34;The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way
they&#39;ve multiplied here they&#39;re making it hard for us to live,&#34; and &#34;Things 
will be just fine if we get rid of them all.&#34; &#34;No problem, the Turks will 
help,&#34; they say, &#34;if we ask them, they&#39;ll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an 
hour.&#34; Well that&#39;s the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it 
would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn&#39;t imagine it. 
Here we&#39;ve been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one 
even considered such an idea possible.

But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative 
people I would often ask, &#34;Where is this all leading, do people really not see
what kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, 
there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what&#39;s going
on?&#34; And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that 
everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of 
it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the
demonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn&#39;t be saying this now if I 
hadn&#39;t received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were 
under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. 
The women told me, &#34;There he is, there he is, that&#39;s Muslimzade.&#34; I didn&#39;t 
believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that 
they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, &#34;Are you the First 
Secretary of our City Party Committee?&#34; He answers me, &#34;Yes.&#34; And I ask him, 
&#34;Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani 
flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don&#39;t know 
exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?&#34; And he tells
me, &#34;Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.&#34; Then I asked him
another question: &#34;And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering 
us? And he said, &#34;I. . . We didn&#39;t know what to do, we didn&#39;t know, we didn&#39;t 
anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.&#34;

Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the 
Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: &#34;No, we actually didn&#39;t 
anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain 
the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.&#34; Those are his 
exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the
Armenian SSR.

And now, about the events themselves. Of course it&#39;s painful to discuss them, 
because it may seem that it&#39;s not true to someone else. Various rumors 
concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren&#39;t. 
But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so 
horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of
progress, I don&#39;t know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in
or around Moscow, I wouldn&#39;t have believed it. Why not? Because it was really 
a genocide, it was a massacre. That&#39;s genuinely what it was.

For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn&#39;t know about the 27th because my 
husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on 
the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, &#34;You&#39;re in bed? You don&#39;t 
know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they 
were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars 
and asking, &#39;Are you an Armenian?&#39; If they answered in Armenian, then they 
turned the car over and burned it.&#34; This isn&#39;t made up, the wife of the Senior
Investigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was 
returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she&#39;s my 
neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the 
middle of it, I don&#39;t know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they 
were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him
honk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn&#39;t even believe it, and 
I said, &#34;Certainly that didn&#39;t happen, how can that be?&#34; And she said, 
&#34;Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely
smashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw 
that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, &#34;Don&#39;t break 
the shop windows, don&#39;t destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.
&#34; I didn&#39;t hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was
torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians 
although he&#39;s an Azerbaijani.

While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova
is the first to look out the window and say, &#34;Look, there&#39;s a crowd out 
there.&#34; And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had 
already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian 
family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I&#39;m sorry, I 
don&#39;t know the building number or the people&#39;s names, since we were in my 
husband&#39;s apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. 
There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things 
were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once 
wasn&#39;t enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn&#39;t finished
the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they 
beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing 
the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on 
television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn&#39;t tell 
us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn&#39;t 
have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn&#39;t dared to stick up for the 
Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.

At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, 
and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly 
off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down 
there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At 
first I couldn&#39;t figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, 
&#34;Lendrush, l think they&#39;re beating someone out there.&#34; And he answered, &#34;I 
don&#39;t know, could be.&#34; Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw 
it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, 
he didn&#39;t see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging 
her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell 
down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their 
balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of 
blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that&#39;s a good block and a half or two 
from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.

Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can
of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And
I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented
that woman, because I had just seen that.

I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, &#34;You kill me first, and then 
let them do what they want with the corpse.&#34; But our neighbors, it&#39;s true, 
defended us, they said, &#34;There aren&#39;t any Armenians in our entryway, go away, 
only Muslims live here.&#34; Disaster missed us that time.

But at two o&#39;clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, 
came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he&#39;s 
upset about something, but I can&#39;t. I was standing, running from balcony to 
balcony. Our power was out, I don&#39;t remember for how long, but it was as 
though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, 
and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look 
and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first 
time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the 
morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the 
Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them 
too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking
garbage out at two o&#39;clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went 
toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you 
could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke 
Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, &#34;What do you want?&#34; And 
they answered, &#34;We want the Armenian family that lives here&#34; [pointing toward 
the second floor with their hands]. She says, &#34;I already told you, we don&#39;t 
have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman 
talking to you,&#34; and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around
her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they 
seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing 
and left. That was the second time death was at our door.

I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, 
I don&#39;t know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we 
really didn&#39;t know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth 
floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight 
months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to 
earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture 
and was getting ready to give his daughter&#39;s hand in marriage, but, alas,
everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything 
out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on 
the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that 
hadn&#39;t already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means 
that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to 
be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been 
foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of 
apartments. Something on the order of &#34;We&#39;ll move the Armenians out and take 
over their apartments.&#34;

I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I 
came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the 
Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I 
knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in 
Sumgait that there wasn&#39;t anything holy about them, that Party membership was 
bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were 
no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw 
all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.

I can&#39;t talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I
went out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they 
had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some 
Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and
joined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with 
the situation the way it was. And what&#39;s interesting is that when we left on 
the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure 
people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for 
the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But 
having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having 
thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. 
If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn&#39;t want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, 
and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to 
calm them down--then is it possible that he didn&#39;t have people at hand to whom
he could whisper at the last minute, &#34;Go and announce it on television: 
Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let&#39;s protect our 
neighbors from this massacre?&#34; Those crowds weren&#39;t such that there was no 
controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn&#39;t have firearms, 
mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature 
shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we 
noticed them: there aren&#39;t rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were 
brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was 
saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend 
us, why wasn&#39;t it arranged? It means that the government didn&#39;t want to do 
it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, 
what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!
The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won&#39;t mention the things 
I didn&#39;t see myself, I&#39;ll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They 
were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o&#39;clock in the evening, when I saw them
from the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one 
o&#39;clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They
hadn&#39;t completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. 
When they returned to our building I told my husband, &#34;Lendrush, now the 
police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably 
going to find out and come to our aid.&#34; Well, alas, no, there were to be no 
authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single 
ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,
beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,
and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, 
it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in 
Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they 
attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed
soldiers, and how on that square, I can&#39;t remember the name of it, where there
is that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I&#39;m upset and
I can&#39;t think of the name . . . there&#39;s a tall building there, a 9-story, and 
from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, 
wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against 
that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using 
stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have 
guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under 
the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under 
Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get 
involved.

If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the
truth, I&#39;ve been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five 
years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered 
me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I&#39;m an adventure seeker, and
some, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become
outraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a 
Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,
or the property of some magnate, or some &#34;mafia&#34;: If I want to, I&#39;ll get you 
out of here; If I want to, I&#39;ll get rid of you; If I want to, I&#39;ll do 
something else? And there&#39;s a black market price for everything, in the most 
brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so
much. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor&#39;s pool, he had 
the nerve to tell me, maybe you won&#39;t even believe this, but this, I&#39;m afraid,
I heard with my own ears: &#34;Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something
that you know will never have any effect? You&#39;re alone against everyone, so 
instead why don&#39;t you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything 
will go fine for you.&#34; I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I 
do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.
And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see
it. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed 
it, I still have a copy, but what&#39;s the use? When the General Procuracy got 
involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to 
the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony 
about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don&#39;t know 
if they&#39;re going to pursue it or not. Because, you&#39;ll excuse me, I no longer 
believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It&#39;s all 
dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most 
important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that&#39;s nonsense, that
all comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in 
you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...

I want to tell of one incident. I just don&#39;t know, at the time I was in such a
state that I didn&#39;t even take minor things into account. Here is an example.
Of course, it&#39;s not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a
son, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,
Vitaly [Danielian], I don&#39;t know his last name, goes to school with him, or
rather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to
make a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there&#39;s one important detail:
When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren&#39;t working in 
Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.
But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call 
anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off
for no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they
liked They weren&#39;t afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap 
their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.

Now I&#39;m going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an
Armenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. 
According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the
same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put
through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to
his mother and said, &#34;Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik&#39;s, what if they kill
him? Maybe he&#39;s still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.
. . . He&#39;s a nice guy, we all like him, he&#39;s a good person, he&#39;s smart.&#34; His 
mother wouldn&#39;t let him go. In tears, she says, &#34;Valery, you can&#39;t go because 
I am afraid.&#34; He says, &#34;Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We&#39;ll just watch, 
just have a look.&#34; They made it through. I don&#39;t know, I think Vitalik&#39;s
parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a 
superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken 
everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian 
apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that 
the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows 
in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and 
Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already 
been murdered. Little Vitalik didn&#39;t even know they were dead. So two weeks 
ago, I don&#39;t know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we 
left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to 
Yerevan. So it&#39;s been about a month already; it&#39;s so hard to keep all this 
straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik&#39;s family has
been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and
his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn&#39;t admit 
them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in 
a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being 
kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought 
there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .

When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, 
throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if 
these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And
when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When
you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.

If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of 
things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped 
were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I&#39;m not lying, 
that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, &#34;What happened?&#34; and she 
bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . 
those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that 
I don&#39;t know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.

Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,
well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,
some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group
of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a
point when I couldn&#39;t even go outside because if you went outside you saw
so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .

Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians
around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground
with bulldozers. I didn&#39;t know whether to believe it or not. And people who 
don&#39;t know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when 
I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are 
not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they 
were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a 
single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan 
all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn&#39;t attack 
anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there
could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don&#39;t
know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are 
guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in
Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not
only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it 
seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; &#34;Did 
you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 
people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an 
Armenian?&#34;

Of course I&#39;m upset, but it&#39;s utterly impossible to discuss such things and
not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to
the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.
When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I 
couldn&#39;t believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already
mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, &#34;Why 
did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at 
these women who are strewn about on the floor?&#34; The overcrowding there was 
tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were
already sick. It&#39;s true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They 
cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but 
the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at 
it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they 
were never given any direct orders, they didn&#39;t know what they were authorized
to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o&#39;clock in the evening
that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, 
was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored 
personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart 
advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.

But that&#39;s not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, 
tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party
Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the
hand and said, &#34;Citizen, don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll go and have a talk in my office.
I told him, &#34;No, after everything you&#39;ve done, I don&#39;t believe one iota of 
what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I&#39;ll disappear, and the 
traces of me will disappear too. Because you can&#39;t stand it when . . . &#34; Oh 
yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even 
very funny, although at the time I wasn&#39;t up to laughing. He was in a nice, 
expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, &#34;Oh, why 
did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,
you&#39;re in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came
to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are
already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at
them?&#34; And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don&#39;t know who 
he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade&#39;s head 
and hid it. Then I said, &#34;My God! We&#39;re not marauders. We&#39;re not you! We 
didn&#39;t come to you with the intention of stealing!&#34; &#34;Well kill me, kill me!&#34; 
Muslimzade says to me, &#34;But I&#39;m not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I&#39;m not
guilty.&#34; And I say, &#34;OK, fine, you&#39;re not guilty, have it your way. But give 
us an answer, we&#39;re asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and 
raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, 
carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you 
then?&#34; &#34;You know, we didn&#39;t expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn&#39;t 
anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.&#34; I started 
laughing and said, &#34;It&#39;s truly funny.&#34; He says, &#34;What could I do? We didn&#39;t 
know what to do.&#34; And I say, &#34;I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;ll be ridiculous if I tell 
you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn&#39;t march out in 
front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross 
over his dead body. That&#39;s what you should have done. That&#39;s the way it was 
during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;
either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran 
away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, 
excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, 
you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? 
That&#39;s right,&#34; I told him, &#34;the City party committee got confused, all the 
party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, 
they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with 
impunity. And if it weren&#39;t for the troops it wouldn&#39;t have been just two 
days, there wouldn&#39;t be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would 
have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some 
Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told 
them, &#39;As soon as we finish with the Armenians we&#39;ll come after you, too.&#34;

And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was
the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later
arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to
the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We 
asked him, &#34;What? How? What will come of us?&#34; He openly said, &#34;You know, for 
us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We&#39;ll finish that quickly. You&#39;ll
stay at the military unit for the time being, and we&#39;ll decide later.&#34; The 
General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all 
cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because 
the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;
as everyone knows, he&#39;s the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When 
he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, 
by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn&#39;t not say it, 
because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, 
and he said, &#34;There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it&#39;s
horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely 
punished, in accordance with our laws.&#34; And that&#39;s a quote. Then one mother 
throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,
&#34;Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?&#34; They tried 
to calm her down, and he said, &#34;In order for us to conduct a proper 
investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you 
must help us, because we don&#39;t know, maybe there was someone else in the gang 
who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe 
someone saw something. Don&#39;t be afraid, write about it in detail. So that 
you&#39;re not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having 
lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth 
about, let&#39;s say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge 
later. We&#39;re going to do it like this: We&#39;re going to set up an urn and you 
can throw what you write in there. We don&#39;t need to know who wrote it. The 
names of the people who write won&#39;t be made public, but we need all the
information. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is 
necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening 
gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put 
the information into the urn.&#34;

Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, 
people who didn&#39;t even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she 
came up and said, &#34;You, as a Russian, the same thing won&#39;t happen to you as 
will happen to me. So please . . . I&#39;ll give you the information, and you 
please write it down for me.&#34; So she was afraid, and there were a lot like
her . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down
everything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don&#39;t know if 
it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that 
information. One person can lie, but thousands can&#39;t lie, thousands simply 
can&#39;t lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, 
should someone say that black is white if it is really black?

   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani
SSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council 
of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the 
one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their 
previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, 
and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very 
politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and 
when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, &#34;Where were
you personally when they were beating us? Now you&#39;re trying to convince us to 
return, why didn&#39;t you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where 
it was all leading?&#34; he says, &#34;You&#39;re telling the truth. Let&#39;s not mince 
words. You&#39;ve told me right to my face, and I&#39;ll tell you straight. I&#39;ll tell 
you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole 
government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about 
45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its 
fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.&#34;
I say, &#34;So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting 
it?&#34; And he says, &#34;You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it 
in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . &#34; I say, &#34;Fine, 
you didn&#39;t know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have 
known. Why did no one help us?&#34; And he says, &#34;Well, OK, we didn&#39;t know what to
do&#34; and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from 
Muslimzade. Later, when he said, &#34;You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is 
favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the 
Azerbaijanis . . . &#34; To this l answered, &#34;You know what . . . I&#39;m speaking 
with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with 
Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, 
please, Comrade Mamedov, &#34; I asked him, &#34;What would you say about this
honestly, if you were being completely frank with us?&#34; Then he said, &#34;Yes, I 
admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we 
have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before 
the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign 
radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.&#34;
And I say, &#34;There&#39;s nothing to add to what really happened. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
possible to add anything more awful.&#34; He says, &#34;Yes, I agree with you, I 
understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.&#34; I repeat that he
said &#34;unfortunate occurrence.&#34; And then he suddenly remembered himself, what 
he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--
and said, &#34;Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . &#34; I take this to mean that 
he really thinks it&#39;s an &#34;unfortunate occurrence.&#34; &#34;And of course,&#34; he says, 
&#34;I understand that having gone through all this you can&#39;t return to Sumgait, 
but it&#39;s necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being 
tried.&#34; And he even gave a detail, which, I don&#39;t know if it matters or not, 
that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody 
affair.

Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in
Baku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an 
Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, &#34;What, they didn&#39;t
nail your husband? They screwed up.&#34; I was floored, I hadn&#39;t imagined that
anyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up
to see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was
going to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from 
February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, &#34;I don&#39;t know, 
Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors&#39; pool. Be grateful if they don&#39;t 
put it down as unexcused absence.&#34; I was really discouraged by this. They all 
know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here 
they&#39;re telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying 
myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name
is Rasulov, and he&#39;s had that position for many years. Incidentally, he&#39;s a 
Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and 
said, &#34;Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . &#34; He looked at me askance
and said, &#34;And why are you&#34;--he knows me by my previous last name--&#34;why did
you get wrapped up in this mess?&#34; I say, &#34;What do you mean, why did I get 
wrapped up in this mess? My husband&#39;s an Armenian,&#34; I tell him, &#34;I have an 
Armenian last name.&#34; And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as 
though he had eaten something sour, and said, &#34;I didn&#39;t expect that you would
. . . &#34; What did he mean by that? And &#34;how&#34; should he behave, the chief of the
pool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it&#39;s true, there was a 
reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And 
if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what 
can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!
He&#39;s going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, 
the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .

By the way, that Mamedov--now I&#39;m going back to Mamedov&#39;s office when I asked 
him &#34;Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return 
to Sumgait?&#34; he answered, &#34;Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don&#39;t
want to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I 
won&#39;t guarantee them for longer than 50 years.&#34; I say, &#34;So you&#39;ve got another
thing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they&#39;ll be quiet and then 
in another 50 years it&#39;ll happen again?!&#34; I couldn&#39;t contain myself any more,
and I also told him, &#34;And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew
about it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in 
Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received
complaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did 
everyone ignore what was going on? Didn&#39;t you prepare people for this by the 
way you treated them?&#34; And he says, &#34;You know, you&#39;re finally starting to 
insult me!&#34; He threw his pen on the desk. &#34;Maybe now you&#39;ll say I&#39;m a 
scoundrel too?&#34; I say, &#34;You know, I&#39;m not talking about you because I don&#39;t 
know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that 
comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.
&#34;Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, 
that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had 
gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. 
&#34;We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of 
the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of 
Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in
Sumgait.&#34; When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, &#39;
&#34;Well, I walked down the street.&#34; And I said, &#34;Walking down the street in any 
city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation
because I would be a guest, I don&#39;t have any contact with people, but if you 
spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn&#39;t 
know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you&#39;d 
hear something quite different.&#34; I told him, for example, that I drew my 
conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took
us all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;
they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the 
neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I 
thought maybe that in fact it wasn&#39;t something general, of a mass nature, some
anti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it
was the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier 
accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything 
there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with
us, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young 
people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they 
were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police
detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and 
tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when 
the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they 
withdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of 
course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .

 President Clinton&#39;s Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President 
Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:

1:36 P.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law
against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled
weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day
standoff ensued.

     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without
bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau&#39;s efforts were
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were
dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably
insane.

     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both
federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,
responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the
action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination
towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no
provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal
agents against the compound.

     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on
an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on
Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.
The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even
in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause
permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people
in the compound to come outside and to surrender.

     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I
discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I
thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what
she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the
implementation of the decision.

     Yesterday&#39;s action ended in a horrible human tragedy.
Mr. Koresh&#39;s response to the demands for his surrender by federal
agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his
captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not
survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate
responsibility for the carnage that ensued.

     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the
future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and
Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to
uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been
dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent
professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I
expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required
to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to
cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can
continue to be fully accountable to the American people.

     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney
General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the
front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult
circumstances.

     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry
for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end
of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be
tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David
Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over
the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult
situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will
be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future
will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what
has been learned now.

     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,
after 51 days, you decided --

     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is
that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation
with --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I can&#39;t hear you both.  If one will go
first and then the other.

     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I&#39;ll answer both your questions, but I
can&#39;t do it at once.

     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about
the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General
that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another
step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she
described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted
to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause
permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it
very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was
hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.

     I was further told that under no circumstances would our
people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to
shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and
there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful
lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.
There were no shots coming back from the government side.

     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I
asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons
I was given were the following:

     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the
federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the
quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be
needed in other parts of the country.

     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had
never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced
that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to
be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult
members to come out.

     Number three, that the danger of their doing something
to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with
the passage of time.

     And number four, that they had reason to believe that
the children who were still inside the compound were being abused
significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and
unsafe conditions.

     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.
The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had
given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and
evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said
that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were
convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only
increase with the passage of time.

     The third question I asked was, has the military been
consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,
that&#39;s the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious
that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military
people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some
of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the
military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they
had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one
minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military
-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming
significance.

     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I
said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she
should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that
today.

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.

     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --
reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were
trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I&#39;m bewildered by it.  The only
reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only
reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to
add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather
late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who
had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into
custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events
to unfold.

     There was -- I have -- I can&#39;t account for why people
speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General
on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.
I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry
King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it
is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that
happen when the federal government is in control.

     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised
would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the
Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics
murdered themselves.  (Applause.)

     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this
life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These
people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were
heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,
and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to
avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate
themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the
children.

     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,
is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you
to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why
you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she
said, it&#39;s because of the children.  They have evidence that those
children are still being abused and that they&#39;re in increasingly
unsafe conditions, and that they don&#39;t think it will get any easier
with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for
that.  So that is where I think things stand.

     Q  Can we assume then that you don&#39;t think this was
mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn&#39;t run out of
patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really
decide that way?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume
is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has
done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of
time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the
World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry
to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we
should have known?  Is there some other question they should have
asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say
for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make
the outcome come different?  I don&#39;t know that.  That&#39;s why I want
the inquiry and that&#39;s why I would like to make sure that we have
some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but
totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best
evidence we have.

     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of
fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it
again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,
particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is
important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the
people who killed others and then killed themselves.

     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options
presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from
February 28th until yesterday?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all
along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go
back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good
job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued
any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them
early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of
the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to
be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the
authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things
just began to spin downward.

     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened
yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not
involve other options except whether we should take more time with
the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they
wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get
people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.
That&#39;s what they thought.

     Q  Did the government know that the children did not
have gas masks?

     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are
you in agreement with that?

     THE PRESIDENT:  That&#39;s up to the Congress.  They can do
whatever they want.  But I think it&#39;s very important that the
Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring
in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any
congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully
cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the
most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the
country.

      | &#34;Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they      |
      |  repeated quite frequently, &#34;Let the Armenian women have babies  |
      |  for us, Muslim babies, let them bear Azerbaijanis for the       |
      |  struggle against the Armenians.&#34; Then they said, &#34;Those         |

...continued from PART A:

The six of them left. They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-
ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the 
physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had 
an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas
ornaments, howling and howling. I didn&#39;t know where I was or how long this 
went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and 
was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into
tears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .

Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I 
want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I&#39;m hallucinating. I am 
silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man&#39;s voice is calling
me, then a woman&#39;s. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the
one whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, 
telling him, &#34;I know that they&#39;ve killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring 
her corpse to me so they don&#39;t violate her corpse.&#34; He went and returned empty
handed, but Mamma thought he just didn&#39;t want to carry the corpse into his 
apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were 
walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn&#39;t answer their calls. 
There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.

They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o&#39;clock, and at 9:30 I 
went down to the Kasumovs&#39;. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the
apartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be 
cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the 
doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, 
opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle 
Sabir&#39;s son started to shout, &#34;Aunt Roza, don&#39;t cry, Lyuda&#39;s alive!&#34; He 
knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. 
Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir&#39;s wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their 
apartment. I didn&#39;t see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying
delirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.
All of my family had gathered there.
   
At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the
apartment.

Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, &#34;Lyuda, 
Karina&#39;s in really serious condition, she&#39;s probably dying. If she recognizes 
you, don&#39;t cry, don&#39;t tell her that her face looks so awful.&#34; It was as though
her whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one 
side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her 
cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole
microdistrict, that&#39;s how disfigured her face was. I said, &#34;Fine.&#34; Mamma was 
afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started 
to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the
bed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye 
that was intact, looked at me, and said, &#34;Who is it?&#34; But I could barely talk, 
my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn&#39;t say, but rather muttered something
tender, something incomprehensible, but tender, &#34;My Karochka, my Karina, my 
little golden one . . . &#34; She understood me.

Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina&#39;s lips. 
She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn&#39;t 
understand it. Then I made out, &#34;It hurts, I hurt all over.&#34; Her hair was 
glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her 
forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don&#39;t know how 
to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She&#39;s
saying something to me, but I can&#39;t understand her. Igor brings her a pencil 
and paper and says, &#34;Write it down.&#34; She shakes her head as if to say, no, I 
can&#39;t write. I can&#39;t understand what she&#39;s saying. She wanted to tell me 
something, but she couldn&#39;t. I say, &#34;Karina, just lie there a little while,
then maybe you&#39;ll feel better and you can tell me then.&#34; And then she says,
&#34;Maybe it&#39;ll be too late.&#34; And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn&#39;t
control myself.

Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped
a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She 
says, &#34;Lyuda, we&#39;re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this 
damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They&#39;ll find us here, too. We need
to call Urshan.&#34; She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I 
understood her every word. I ask, &#34;What&#39;s his number?&#34; Urshan Feyruzovich, 
that&#39;s the head of the administration where she works. &#34;We have to call him.&#34; 
But I didn&#39;t know his home number. I say, &#34;Karina, what&#39;s his number?&#34; She 
says, &#34;I can&#39;t remember.&#34; I say, &#34;Who knows his number? Who can I call?&#34; She 
says, &#34;I don&#39;t know anything, leave me alone.&#34;

I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was 
crying, too. I say, &#34;Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can 
we call him? Who knows his telephone number?&#34; I tell Marina, &#34;Think, think, 
who can we call to find out?&#34; She started calling; several people didn&#39;t 
answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and 
found out the number and called us back. The boss&#39;s wife answered and said he 
was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can&#39;t talk normally. She says, 
&#34;Lyuda, don&#39;t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and 
tell them that they just can&#39;t do that.&#34; She still didn&#39;t know what was really
going on. I said, &#34;It&#39;s easy for you to say that, you don&#39;t understand what&#39;s 
happening. They are killing people here. I don&#39;t think there is a single 
Armenian left in the building, they&#39;ve cut them all up. I&#39;m even surprised 
that we managed to save ourselves. &#34;She says, &#34;Well, OK, if it&#39;s that serious 
. . . &#34; And all the same she&#39;s thinking that my emotions are all churned up 
and that I&#39;m fearing for my life, that in fact it&#39;s not all that bad. &#34;OK, 
fine, fine,&#34; she says, &#34;if you&#39;re afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back 
I&#39;ll send him over.&#34;

We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly 
under Aunt Tanya&#39;s, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian&#39;s apartment. She 
wasn&#39;t home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed 
everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on
trying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan&#39;s wife is named Tanya too and 
finally we get through. She says, &#34;Yes, he&#39;s come home, he&#39;s leaving for your 
place now.&#34; He came. Of course he didn&#39;t know what was happening, either, 
because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep 
with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what 
shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has 
grown up daughters, they&#39;re almost my age.

The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and
went down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, 
first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As
soon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said
that we were in serious condition and that we mustn&#39;t move, we might have
fractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the
first floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around
eleven o&#39;clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I 
saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies
. . . everything just like a war.

They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical
people from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older 
Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she&#39;s so proud 
she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle 
Arkady, I think, because someone said &#34;Arkady, get an injection ready,&#34; he 
started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But 
when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his 
sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and 
started to cry: &#34;What have they done to you?!&#34; He was speaking Armenian. &#34;What
have they done to you?!&#34; Karina didn&#39;t say anything. Mamma came in then, and 
she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. &#34;I&#39;ll give you a shot.&#34; 
Mamma tells him, &#34;I don&#39;t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what 
are they doing? Look what they&#39;ve done to my children! They&#39;re killing people,
and you&#39;re just sitting here!&#34; Some teacups were standing on the table in 
there. &#34;You&#39;re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they&#39;ve done to my 
daughters! Look what they&#39;ve turned them into!&#34; They gave her something to 
drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the
doctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa 
and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina 
out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I 
don&#39;t know, maybe there weren&#39;t any orderlies. Then they came to me: &#34;What&#39;s 
the matter with you?&#34; Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter
in the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya&#39;s.
I said, &#34;I&#39;m fine.&#34; Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told 
the doctor, &#34;You leave, let a woman examine her.&#34; A woman came, an 
Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, &#34;What&#39;s wrong with you?&#34; I was wearing my 
sister Lyuda&#39;s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When 
she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would 
be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed
her. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge 
wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said 
something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be 
dressed with something, but that they&#39;d do that in the hospital.

They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. 
I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don&#39;t 
know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, &#34;Lie still, you mustn&#39;t move.&#34; When
I was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed 
very familiar to me. I shouted, &#34;Stop!&#34; One of the policemen turned and says, 
&#34;What do you want?&#34; I say, &#34;Bring him to me, I want to look at him.&#34; They 
brought him over and I said, &#34;That person was just in our apartment and he 
just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.&#34; They said, 
&#34;Fine,&#34; but didn&#39;t write it down and led him on. I don&#39;t know where they were 
taking him.

Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were 
sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car 
up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, &#34;Sister . . . &#34; I don&#39;t 
remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they
did to us. I asked him, &#34;Where are you from?&#34; He said that he was from Ufa. 
Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I 
learned that they suffered most of all. He says, &#34;OK, you&#39;re Armenians, they 
didn&#39;t get along with you, but I&#39;m a Russian,&#34; he says, &#34;what are they trying 
to kill me for?&#34; Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the 
balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw 
two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed 
against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him
with his own club. The way he cried &#34;Mamma&#34; made my skin crawl. I don&#39;t know 
what they did to him, if he&#39;s still alive or not. And something else. Before 
he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the
third or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn&#39;t think it was 
Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they
were throwing something they didn&#39;t need out, or someone was fighting with 
someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the 
yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that
I realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.

They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too 
and said, &#34;I&#39;ve been beaten too, help me.&#34; But they just ignored her. My 
father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault 
that he&#39;d been beaten, and says, &#34;My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have 
probably broken my ribs. Please look at them.&#34; The doctor says, &#34;That&#39;s not my
job.&#34; Urshan said, &#34;Fine, I&#39;ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, 
I&#39;ll find you one. I&#39;ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them 
to his apartment.

Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the 
doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I 
wasn&#39;t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very
surprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the
Hippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--
coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,
having examined Karina, said, &#34;No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like 
they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.
&#34;Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn&#39;t say anything--she
would certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same 
story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no 
drugs. Absolutely none! They didn&#39;t even give us tea. All the women there soon
found out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And
they started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at 
zoo animals. Karina didn&#39;t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from 
seeing it.

They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn&#39;t have 
any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their 
place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira 
her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And
Ira was holding her daughter&#39;s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.
When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she 
involuntarily let go of her daughter&#39;s hand, her daughter took her hand again.
Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she&#39;s 11 years old. I felt really awful 
when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, &#34;Do what
you want with me, just leave my daughter alone.&#34; Well, they did what they 
wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I 
would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It 
was simply Bartholomew&#39;s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do 
every day: steal, kill, rape . . .

Many are surprised that those animals didn&#39;t harm the children. The beasts 
explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those 
children would be grown, and then, as they put it, &#34;we&#39;ll come take the 
pleasure out of their lives, those children.&#34; This was about the girls that
would be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow 
because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just
as there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be 
of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the 
victims testified to it. That&#39;s how they described their own natures, that
they would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they
themselves said that.

And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn&#39;t harm our Marina. Many 
people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don&#39;t know 
why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn&#39;t slept the night before, 
maybe for some other reason, I don&#39;t know. But they hadn&#39;t been smoking and 
they weren&#39;t drunk, I&#39;m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at 
nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with 
Marina: &#34;Little sister, don&#39;t be afraid, we won&#39;t harm you, don&#39;t look over 
there [where I was], you might be frightened. You&#39;re a Muslim, a Muslim woman 
shouldn&#39;t see such things.&#34; So they were really quite sober . . .

So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all 
happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn&#39;t even a day, of those several 
hours. Father still can&#39;t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what
happened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he&#39;s started talk-
ing to himself, I&#39;ve heard him argue with himself several times when he
thought no one is listening: &#34;Listen,&#34; he&#39;ll say, &#34;what could I do? What could
I do alone, how could I protect them?&#34; I don&#39;t know where to find the words,
it&#39;s not that I&#39;m happy, but I am glad that he didn&#39;t see it all happen. 
That&#39;s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of 
course he knows it all, but there&#39;s no way you could imagine every last detail
of what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke
together in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never
present at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And
when the investigator comes to the house, we don&#39;t speak with Father present.

On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.
First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, 
the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. 
There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family 
there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They 
were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik&#39;s wife 
and Grant&#39;s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.

Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.
There&#39;s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.
They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought
that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become
so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.
The women were shouting. They explained to them: &#34;We want to hide you
better because it&#39;s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.&#34;

We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We
had children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to 
have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. 
They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you 
could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the 
police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is 
surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it&#39;s electrified, but if they were 
standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought 
great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn&#39;t 
just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn&#39;t slept for 24 hours, or 48,
or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost 
family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened 
when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn&#39;t see a single
person, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must
have already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret 
room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at
one another . . . That&#39;s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those 
people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that
the end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the 
hospital and didn&#39;t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my 
parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should 
attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an 
Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and 
she wouldn&#39;t be able to take it.

Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people 
climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.
They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We 
calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some 
little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children
to the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never 
have occurred to any of us that we hadn&#39;t eaten for two days and that people 
do eat.

Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They 
were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from 
the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a 
different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, 
and calling out: &#34;Oh, Rafik!,&#34; but when she heard about this such a rage came 
over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her 
sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were 
soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were
standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up
to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash 
him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not 
one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from 
doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, 
muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile
appeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round
was over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing 
terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the 
creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did 
this the whole night through, well, it wasn&#39;t really night, no one slept. She 
went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, 
&#34;What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they 
raped, and you&#39;re just sitting there. You&#39;re sitting and talking as though 
nothing had happened. Aren&#39;t you Armenians?&#34; She appealed to everyone, but no 
one got up. I was just numb, I didn&#39;t have the strength to beat anyone, I 
could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so 
many hours--I was released at eleven o&#39;clock in the morning and it was already
after ten at night because there weren&#39;t enough chairs, really it was the 
elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. 
There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. 
The situation was deplorable.

At eleven o&#39;clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, 
Azerbaijanis. They said, &#34;Get up. They&#39;ve brought mattresses, you can wash up
and put the children to bed.&#34; Now the women didn&#39;t want to leave this place, 
either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with 
dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, &#34;Oh, it&#39;s our little 
family,&#34; and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for 
the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone
spoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded
machine guns in their hands, said, &#34;Grandmother, you mustn&#39;t approach me,
I&#39;m on guard.&#34; Our people would say, &#34;Oh, that&#39;s all right.&#34; They hugged
them, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly
moving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.

They took us up to the second floor and said, &#34;You can undress and sleep in 
here. Don&#39;t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it&#39;s quiet in the city.&#34;
This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other
places. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the
SK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I 
asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.
I didn&#39;t know what was happening there. They told me, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, the
Maternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest
assured. I say, &#34;Well, I won&#39;t rest assured regardless, because the staff in
there is capable of anything.&#34;

When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had
already been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-
tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once
we were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met 
acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who 
hadn&#39;t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with 
them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had 
come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like 
they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, 
hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of 
course the stories and the talk were flying: &#34;Oh, I heard that they killed 
him!&#34; &#34;What do you mean they killed him!&#34; &#34;He stayed at work!&#34; &#34;Do you know 
what&#39;s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.

And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very 
well and respect him highly. I&#39;ve known him for a long time. They had a small 
room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night 
talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary 
of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see 
Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed 
from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask 
him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by 
soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn&#39;t deign to speak with 
the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.

Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, &#34;Lyudochka, find another 
two or three. We&#39;re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, 
lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people 
who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.&#34; I 
had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, &#34;Lyuda, your 
Mamma has arrived, she&#39;s looking for you, she doesn&#39;t believe that you are 
alive and well and that you&#39;re here.&#34; I gave the lists to someone and asked 
them to continue what I was doing and went off.

The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian&#39;s
father, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels
Grigorian&#39;s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the 
name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said 
that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front
of the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later 
it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had
somehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for 
Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that 
in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored 
missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3

All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don&#39;t remember how many dead were 
contained in the list, but it&#39;s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple 
of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, &#34;What&#39;s 
going on?&#34; He said, &#34;Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels
they are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev
[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to
him, so that he&#39;d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it
was one or fifty.&#34; They told him that the list had disappeared and they
should ask everyone who hadn&#39;t left for the Khimik boarding house all over
again. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26
was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because
that&#39;s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 
people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only 
a half of those that were on the first list. He said, &#34;Lyuda, please, try to
remember at least one more.&#34; But I couldn&#39;t remember anyone else. But there
were more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy
don&#39;t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people 
whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren&#39;t registered as victims of
the Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn&#39;t know. So many 
people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns
in Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the 
Krasnodarsk Territory. We don&#39;t have any information on them. I know that 
there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical 
Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk 
cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went 
to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering
the city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the 
Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there&#39;s
more. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list 
drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course
don&#39;t know them all. I&#39;m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to 
publicize what had happened, that is, they didn&#39;t take the matter to court, 
they simply left. But in so doing they didn&#39;t cease being victims. One of them
is the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. 
8, on the fifth floor. I can&#39;t tell you the building number and I don&#39;t know 
her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in 
Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don&#39;t know her name, she lives on the 
same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding 
the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn&#39;t hold the door forever, and 
when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors&#39; they seized her by her 
braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because 
they didn&#39;t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one 
. . . I don&#39;t remember who the third one was anymore.

They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn&#39;t herself. Yes, we lived for
days in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there 
and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn&#39;t stay with Karina; 
it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could 
already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the 
social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, 
&#34;If it weren&#39;t for the work I would go insane.&#34; He and I put ourselves in gear
and took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers 
and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, 
although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been 
dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it 
was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by
to see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly
visible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.

On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir
Fedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered 
only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.
Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.

Shirokov was involved with Karina&#39;s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I 
told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and
record everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. 
We didn&#39;t work with the identikit until the very last day because the
conditions weren&#39;t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor 
quality work solely because the situation wasn&#39;t conducive to working: there 
weren&#39;t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a 
curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or 
video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We&#39;re not so poor that 
we can&#39;t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially 
to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw
that the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to 
Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with 
Bibishev, I told him myself, &#34;Don&#39;t you worry, if it takes us a month or two 
months, I&#39;ll be here. I&#39;m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in
those two days, I&#39;ll help you conduct the investigation.&#34;

He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I
gave them so much to do that for a while they didn&#39;t have the time to get to
her, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-
self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-
rays. She couldn&#39;t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn&#39;t eat
and drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we
were in Baku already, the investigator told me, &#34;How long can you go on like 
this? Well fine, so you don&#39;t want to eat, you don&#39;t love yourself, you&#39;re
not taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this
investigation through. We need you.&#34; Then I started eating, because in fact I
was exhausted. It wasn&#39;t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-
ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement
cells and prisons. I don&#39;t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in
every prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of
Sumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary 
confinement.

Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma 
identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn&#39;t identify 
anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren&#39;t among the 
photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one 
who went after the axe. He still hasn&#39;t been detained, he&#39;s still on the 
loose. He&#39;s gone, and it&#39;s not clear if he will be found or not. I don&#39;t know 
his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his 
sisters&#39; faces. But he&#39;s not in the city. The investigators informed me that 
even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will 
continue looking for him.

The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various 
plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.
Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only
one of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and
Chemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-
tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front
of me &#34;I&#39;ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash
simply for keeping him out of Armenia,&#34; that is, to keep him from landing in
a prison on Armenian soil. They&#39;re all terribly afraid of that, because if the
investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn&#39;t confess even
though we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological
pressure--they say, &#34;Fine, don&#39;t confess, just keep silent. When you&#39;re in an
Armenian prison, when they find out who you are, they&#39;ll take care of you
in short order.&#34; That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.

The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire
pogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then
that I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was 
in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and 
all the valuables, but didn&#39;t take a single book. They tore them up, burned 
them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials
from the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James 
Fenimore Cooper&#39;s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were 
boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had 
been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That&#39;s 
enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don&#39;t
even know anything about books. They didn&#39;t take a single book, but they did 
take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out 
slippers.

Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. 
Basically, the group that went seeking &#34;revenge&#34;--let&#39;s use their word for 
it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with 
one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that 
black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking
part in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of 
Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently
arrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I 
don&#39;t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an 
Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know 
nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an 
axe. Murdering her wasn&#39;t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and 
threw them into the tub with water.

I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You 
know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both 
their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-
eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I 
identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born
in the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How 
did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I 
kept thinking, is that Rita or &#34;puma,&#34; which it would be if you read the word 
as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic &#34;T&#34; was the one 
that looks like a Latin &#34;M.&#34; When they led him in he sat with his hands behind
his back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to
put in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and 
told me that I was making a mistake, and called me &#34;dear sister.&#34; He said, 
&#34;You&#39;re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an 
Armenian,&#34; and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator 
asked me, &#34;Lyuda, are you sure it was he?&#34; I told him, &#34;I&#39;ll tell you one more
identifying mark. If I&#39;m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The 
name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.&#34; He went rigid and became 
pale. They told him, &#34;Put your hands on the table.&#34; He put his hands on the
table with the palms up. I said, &#34;Now turn your hands over,&#34; but he didn&#39;t 
turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start
acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn&#39;t wanted to do it, that they 
forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.
But he insolently stuck to his story, &#34;No, I did not do anything, it wasn&#39;t 
me.&#34; When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his
hand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew
into a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out 
of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. 
Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked
and the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and 
back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don&#39;t know how, 
but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or 
strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the 
microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his
last name, and he says, &#34;Lyudochka, it&#39;s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .
&#34; And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. 
They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, 
because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, &#34;You&#39;re 
some actress! What a performance!&#34; I said, &#34;Tolya, honestly . . . &#34; Beforehand
they would always tell me, &#34;Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if 
nothing had happened to you.&#34; I say, &#34;I don&#39;t have any more strength or 
emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength 
. . . I don&#39;t have the strength to do anything.&#34; And he says, &#34;Lyuda, how were
you able to do that?&#34; And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching
the tape, I said, &#34;Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped 
that high in gym class.&#34;

So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of 
the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who 
beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.

At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his 
guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among
them were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, 
&#34;Tomorrow we&#39;re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three
o&#39;clock.&#34; He said, &#34;No, I&#39;m not coming.&#34; They told him, &#34;If you don&#39;t come 
we&#39;ll kill you.&#34; He said, &#34;Alright, I&#39;ll come.&#34; And he went.

They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He
had also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a 
motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him 
out of his apartment and told him the same thing: &#34;Tomorrow we&#39;re going to get
the Armenians. Be there.&#34; He said, &#34;No.&#34; They pulled a knife on him. He said, 
&#34;I&#39;m not going all the same.&#34; And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed 
him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was
in the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that 
we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.

I&#39;ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he
beat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he
was very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for
him, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning
of Shagen Sargisian. I don&#39;t know if he participated in the rapes in our 
apartment; I didn&#39;t see, I don&#39;t remember. But the people who were in our 
apartment who didn&#39;t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I 
don&#39;t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don&#39;t recall because I blacked
out very often. But I think that he didn&#39;t participate in the rape of Karina
because he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the
courtyard, he remained in the apartment.

At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her
I learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn&#39;t 
have a father, and that he&#39;s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third
and, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work
with bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.

The others who were detained . . . well they&#39;re little beasts. You really can&#39;t
call them beasts, they&#39;re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out
someone else&#39;s will, because at the investigation they all said, &#34;I don&#39;t 
understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.&#34; But we know that
they were won around to it and prepared for it, that&#39;s why they did it. In the
name of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--
that&#39;s holy to them--that&#39;s why they did everything they were commanded to do.
Because I saw they didn&#39;t have minds of their own, I&#39;m not talking about their
level of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they
work, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they 
crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were 
promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.
So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, &#34;they 
promised us apartments.&#34;

Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the
heart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a 
children&#39;s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at 
the children&#39;s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they 
have they earned by their own labor, and wasn&#39;t inherited from parents or 
grandparents. And he said, &#34;I didn&#39;t need anything I just don&#39;t know . . . how
I ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my 
own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.&#34; And the whole time I
kept repeating, &#34;Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife 
right before your own eyes.&#34; He sat there and just wailed.

But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a 
marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they&#39;ll get onto him, they just 
have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his
grandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how 
to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he 
knew and those he didn&#39;t, either, and other things as well, and changed 
himself like a chameleon so they wouldn&#39;t get onto him, but he was detained.

That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians&#39; after Aleksandr 
Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, &#34;Let&#39;s go, enough, you&#39;ve spilled
enough blood here.&#34;

Maybe Karina doesn&#39;t know this but the reason they didn&#39;t finish her off was 
that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya
and her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They 
liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When 
Karina came to at one point--she doesn&#39;t remember this yet, this the neighbors 
old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to 
the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were 
already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians&#39;. They came back
and started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have 
sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older 
woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of 
Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.
The woman&#39;s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands 
and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, 
he sees everything, and He won&#39;t forgive this.

There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first 
floor, she&#39;s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a
custom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.
But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is 
tantamount to trampling a woman&#39;s honor.

Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we 
have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these 
events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come 
about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it&#39;s clear that 
without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not 
have happened. All the same, I&#39;m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,
let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their 
nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are 
a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for
what they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like
unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn&#39;t have time to do everything, they 
threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,
to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on
February 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone 
who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left
for their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got
as far away as their legs would carry them.

February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came 
into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had 
been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for 
a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few 
teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or 
seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there 
were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the 
evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and 
the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the 
microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the 
driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani
child off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had
seen it himself..The crowd started to rage: &#34;Death to the Armenians! They must
be killed!&#34; Then a woman went up on stage. I didn&#39;t see the woman because 
people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The 
woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians 
cut her daughters&#39; breasts off, and called, &#34;Sons, avenge my daughters!&#34; That 
was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the 
direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.

We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a 
very nationalist speech. He said, &#34;Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!&#34; This 
he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him 
stormily, whistling and shouting &#34;Karabagh!&#34; He said, &#34;Karabagh has been our 
territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my 
heart?&#34; As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. &#34;It&#39;s our 
territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. 
From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from
time immemorial, that&#39;s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years 
the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.&#34; By filth he meant 
Armenians.

I heard this. Before that I hadn&#39;t been listening to the speeches closely.
Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with 
the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn&#39;t penetrate,
that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our
teachers said, &#34;Listen to what he&#39;s saying, listen to what idiocy he&#39;s 
spouting,&#34; we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we 
listened to the woman&#39;s speech.

Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the 
subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of
studies, for whom I had great respect, he&#39;s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I
had considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to 
obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,
&#34;Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If 
they find out that you&#39;re an Armenian they&#39;ll tear you to pieces. Should I 
tell them you&#39;re an Armenian? Should I tell them you&#39;re an Armenian?&#34; When he 
said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a 
second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already
after eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, 
&#34;No, they said that women should stay here until ten o&#39;clock,.and men, until 
twelve. Stay here.&#34; There was a young teacher with us, her children were in 
kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: &#34;I left my 
children at the kindergarten.&#34; The director excused her. When she let her go I
turned around, said, &#34;Good-bye,&#34; and left with the young teacher, the 
Azerbaijani. I didn&#39;t see them after that.

When we were walking the buses weren&#39;t running, and a crowd from the rally ran
nearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too 
much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed 
off. I wasn&#39;t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher 
wouldn&#39;t say that I was an Armenian.

To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at 
the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and
again my parents didn&#39;t understand that we were in danger. We watched 
television as usual, and didn&#39;t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last 
day. That&#39;s how it all was.

At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,
Zhanna, I don&#39;t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store 
on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she 
doesn&#39;t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father 
held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the 
ground was wet and that there wasn&#39;t anyone behind the building when she went 
out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the 
entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders 
there. She jumped. She jumped and didn&#39;t feel any pain in the heat of the 
moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn&#39;t stand up, she had been 
injured somehow. That&#39;s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, 
and their children: any way they could. 

Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father&#39;s first cousin, 
Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims 
what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one 
another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even 
with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and 
their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got 
them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked 
electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then 
they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she&#39;s an 
Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director
and told her that if she didn&#39;t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to 
escape alive and unharmed, she&#39;d never see her daughter again. I&#39;m sure, of 
course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only
thing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The 
Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored 
personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and
led everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored 
personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that 
very moment, into Block 30. That&#39;s how they defended themselves.

I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They&#39;re big, 
strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a 
strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.

One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking 
for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, 
people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps 
dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went 
with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found 
Azerbaijani corpses. I don&#39;t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and 
put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or 
infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the 
neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject 
came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the 
basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor
carried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing 
as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor 
took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything 
seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing 
of ours he had managed to &#34;save.&#34;

Raya&#39;s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended 
themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were
Azerbaijani victims, although we&#39;ll never hear anything about them. For some 
reason our government doesn&#39;t want to say that the Armenians were not just 
victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. 
In the TV show &#34;Pozitsiya&#34; [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that 
the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that&#39;s not 
important, the truth will come out regardless.

So that&#39;s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our 
bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the 
years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we&#39;ve 
become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.

On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said
that it&#39;s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments
received by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans 
will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the 
Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-
tion. That&#39;s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on 
the street at night, to not be afraid to say we&#39;re Armenians, and to not fear
speaking our native tongue.

DEPOSITION OF KARINE (KARINA) GRIGOREVNA M. [1]

Born 1964

On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o&#39;clock show,
at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards 
away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, &#34;The Abyss.&#34; 
Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at 
the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there&#39;s no conversation 
whatsoever, and we couldn&#39;t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it 
was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if 
someone gave a speech or not, we didn&#39;t know. We bought our tickets. There 
were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that 
large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the
film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well 
mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an 
Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that 
they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do 
to Armenian girls. I thought that&#39;s what they meant because they had demanded 
a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move 
over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone 
recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. 
It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it&#39;s
only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. 
Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, 
people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the 
auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and 
gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, &#34;OK, we&#39;ve 
scared them enough, let&#39;s leave.&#34; They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to 
me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of 
&#34;anasha&#34;, or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like 
they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing 
had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful 
films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We 
could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, 
and it was dark . . .

Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that&#39;s the center of town. Lenin
Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, 
something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren&#39;t especially 
listening, because the way we were feeling we didn&#39;t know if we were going to 
make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation 
wasn&#39;t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, 
policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the
doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors 
there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-
stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some 
naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, 
since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super 
serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we 
live literally one stop away. We didn&#39;t want to go on foot, not because it was
dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the 
driver didn&#39;t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and 
he said he&#39;d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, 
OK . . .

So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was 
happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation 
was at a standstill and everyone was shouting &#34;Ka-ra-bagh,&#34; they&#39;re not going 
to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what&#39;s going on, and there&#39;s
immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had 
come, they were going to come, kill us, that&#39;s it . . . Somehow we managed to 
cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,
just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma 
down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though 
nothing had happened.

That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn&#39;t go anywhere and 
didn&#39;t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.
That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn&#39;t
guess.

On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always
had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, 
Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and 
no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that 
morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at
home and didn&#39;t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda 
Zimogliad, came by at around three o&#39;clock I think. We worked together, we did
our apprenticeships together, she&#39;s a Russian girl. She said that something
awful was happening in town. I asked, &#34;Don&#39;t they want Armenians? Well what 
are they after, if they&#39;re already in that state?&#34; She says, no, nothing like 
that, it&#39;s just a demonstration, but it&#39;s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels
like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The 
cabs, the buses, well it&#39;s just a nightmare.

Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy 
problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,
asked him, &#34;Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going
on in the courtyard; aren&#39;t you afraid to go out?&#34; Papa didn&#39;t know what she
was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home 
and told Mamma. Mamma said, &#34;Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means
that something is really going on.&#34; But we didn&#39;t go see her, she&#39;s a Russian,
she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o&#39;clock I 
tell Lyuda, &#34;Ok, look, it&#39;s time for you to go, it&#39;s late already, I&#39;ll see 
you out.&#34; Mamma says, &#34;You don&#39;t need to go, it&#39;s too late already, you can 
see what the situation in town is.&#34; So we decided to stay home. Dinner was 
ready. Mamma says, &#34;Let her eat with us, then she can go.&#34; We sat down at the 
table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything 
out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we&#39;re eating.
We turned on the television, and the show &#34;In Fairy-Tale Land&#34; was coming on. 
We cleared the table.

We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can&#39;t 
see what&#39;s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus
station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people 
. . . I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s happening. They&#39;re shouting something, looking
somewhere, I can&#39;t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she&#39;s 
an Azerbaijani; we&#39;ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down
to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story 
buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 
people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see 
several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide
that means it&#39;s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they&#39;re not 
killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of 
the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their 
feet, everyone&#39;s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in 
general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can&#39;t speak
. . . Well, they&#39;ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .
If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him
and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn&#39;t see if he
got up and left or not.

I become terrified and go home and say, &#34;Lyuda, don&#39;t go anywhere, stay at our
place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . &#34; Then the crowd 
runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and 
starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors 
are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is 
shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it 
turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and 
kept them from coming in. There&#39;s only one entryway there, they could stop 
them.

They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,
afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the 
windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, 
and it&#39;s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don&#39;t 
crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It&#39;s just a huge
cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey 
Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear 
tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous 
din and roar. It&#39;s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were 
shouting Father&#39;s name, &#34;Grisha, open the door, we&#39;ve come to kill you!,&#34; or
something like that. I don&#39;t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma 
says, &#34;Into the bedroom, quickly!&#34; In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part 
of our dowry; Mamma says, &#34;Hide there, they probably won&#39;t come in there, 
they&#39;ll ask something, say something, and leave.&#34; She says, &#34;We&#39;ll tell them 
that we live alone here.&#34; I can&#39;t imagine that my parents will stand out in 
the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say 
that I&#39;ll stand together with them, I&#39;ll talk with them if they come, maybe I 
can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak 
Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and
Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can&#39;t remember if I told 
her anything or not.

Then . . . they open the door: it&#39;s like they blew on it and it broke and fell
right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,
leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I
tell them, &#34;What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what
has happened.&#34; In Azerbaijani, they say, &#34;Get out of the apartment, leave.&#34; I 
say, &#34;OK. Go downstairs. We&#39;ll gather everything we need and leave the 
apartment.&#34; I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with
them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the
doorway, the young guys, say, &#34;There are old people and one girl with them.
Too bad!&#34; They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have
pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, 
commanding them: &#34;Don&#39;t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?&#34;

And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one
room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start 
undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, 
in front of Mamma. I don&#39;t remember where they went, what they did, or how 
much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,
and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don&#39;t even know what I said. The 
atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among 
themselves who would go first.

Later, I remember, I came to. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m dead or alive. Someone comes
in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. 
He looks around at what&#39;s happening. At that instant everything stops. It 
seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything
depends on him. He looks and says, &#34;Well, we&#39;re done here.&#34; They are beating
Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs 
. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she&#39;s dead. Papa . . . was
out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can&#39;t get the 
window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the 
windows can&#39;t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking 
about being thrown out the window and passed out. She&#39;s not a real strong 
person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I&#39;m saying something, that
I&#39;m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, 
which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they 
don&#39;t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I&#39;m dead, why would I 
humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that&#39;s what I think, since my
tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing 
. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.

I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don&#39;t 
know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by 
my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, 
something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone
else is pinching me . . .I don&#39;t even know. I think, my God, when will death 
come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near
the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What 
happened after that, how many people there were, I don&#39;t remember.
 
I come to after a while, I don&#39;t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me 
clothing. I&#39;m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember 
that I said the same words over and over again: &#34;Mamma, what happened, Mamma, 
what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?&#34; I can&#39;t make 
sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he
served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all 
went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his 
courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors&#39;, even though 
he&#39;s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he 
served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served
there, I think; now he&#39;s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor 
brought me to the neighbors&#39;, and then helped me come to my senses, saying, 
&#34;Karina, I know you, calm down, I&#39;m not one of them.&#34; How do I know who&#39;s who 
and what&#39;s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then
Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when 
they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda 
said that she was Russian, they said, we&#39;ll let you go, we aren&#39;t touching the
Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she&#39;s going 
to tell them she&#39;s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina&#39;s and Lyuda&#39;s 
hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our 
sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor&#39;s and starts pounding 
on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in 
there. So they survived.

My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.
While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back 
up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed 
there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put 
it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor&#39;s on the fourth floor, the
one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and 
knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, &#34;I&#39;m not going to let you 
in the apartment because I&#39;m afraid of them. But I&#39;ll give you some stockings 
and we&#39;ll leave the building.&#34; Lyuda says, &#34;I&#39;ll stay at your place because of
what&#39;s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.&#34; It was just for a 
moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn&#39;t consent. Lyuda came 
back to our place and lay under the bed . . .

I came to. Mother was there. I can&#39;t remember my supervisor&#39;s telephone 
number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he 
came to get us. He didn&#39;t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were 
simply afraid, he didn&#39;t know that they were killing us and that we had passed
between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.
There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, 
it was hard to breathe . . .

My supervisor&#39;s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He&#39;s the head of our 
administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number
of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary 
passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right 
after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a 
great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and
what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not 
only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, 
without stopping. After us.

I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from
Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died
from Building 16, that&#39;s the building in front of ours. There young 
Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn&#39;t let it into their building. 
Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors&#39;, Marina called our relatives
to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in 
Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, &#34;Run
quickly, I can&#39;t explain what&#39;s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay
alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis&#39;, ones who won&#39;t give you away.&#34; At that moment 
three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such
awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, 
there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything 
out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face
was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my
normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to 
scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you 
here, haven&#39;t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of 
the soldiers said, &#34;Don&#39;t scream at us. We&#39;re Muslims, but we&#39;re not from the 
Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.&#34; So at that point the 
Daghestan police were there.

When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,
there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don&#39;t know,
maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously 
injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don&#39;t know what they 
were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda 
and me and said, &#34;These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don&#39;t 
know what to do with the rest.&#34;

So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My 
boss said, &#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter
what happens.&#34; We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department
head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She 
examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait 
ambulances hadn&#39;t done anything, they didn&#39;t respond to any calls. People 
called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.

That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something
very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, 
&#34;God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?&#34; She looks me over and 
says, &#34;Now why are you suffering so? You don&#39;t know what your people have been
doing, your people did even worse things.&#34; And I think, great, I have to deal 
with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don&#39;t I just die so as not to
have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this 
condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn&#39;t 
have the energy to say, &#34;How could our people possibly be smart enough to 
think of something that yours haven&#39;t already done?&#34; I stayed there. Then they
brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her 
own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next 
morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn&#39;t do anything to help us. This
was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn&#39;t do anything 
more than examine me, that was it. I didn&#39;t want any shots or tranquilizer, 
nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn&#39;t even want to look at 
them.

I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-
pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That
same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face
was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, &#34;Better to ask 
your brother what happened, there&#39;s no point in asking me, your brother can 
better explain what happened.&#34; She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw 
themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my
ward.

Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me 
clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, 
but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up 
above my knees, and the woman orderly said, &#34;I can&#39;t believe you put on such a
short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?&#34; I went back to my 
ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and 
brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I 
couldn&#39;t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said
that I couldn&#39;t take the apples, and really didn&#39;t have any appetite. No one 
had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . 
Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should 
be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an 
Armenian, maybe they wouldn&#39;t figure it out from looking at me. So they must 
have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something 
else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on
the street, I don&#39;t know. In any case, I didn&#39;t sleep a wink that night.

The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, 
and off we went. I didn&#39;t even know where they were taking me. They took me to
the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.
I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many 
troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw 
a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought 
that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait 
after that night. I still didn&#39;t know what happened to my parents, they didn&#39;t 
come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. 
I didn&#39;t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm 
me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw 
a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each 
other and asking, &#34;What happened, what went on?&#34; Two days later they came to 
see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed 
interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they 
could. Of course I&#39;m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues 
who didn&#39;t lose his presence of mind and who didn&#39;t change his opinions, 
neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what 
happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart 
. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, 
not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part 
of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements
with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by
myself I couldn&#39;t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my
lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I 
lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be 
from all the blows, I don&#39;t know. They didn&#39;t diagnose anything in particular.
When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of 
insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. 
There was no way something inside wasn&#39;t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took 
me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were 
emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina&#39;s 
friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children&#39;s Clinic. 
They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I
needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty
breathing, I couldn&#39;t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.
They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some
people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all
bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I
wasn&#39;t cut.

They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon 
appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not 
talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, &#34;We 
demand that Seidov come!&#34; The response was, &#34;It&#39;s Seidov who sent us.&#34; Seidov 
is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, 
&#34;We&#39;ll only see Seidov&#39;s daughter, have her come here, we&#39;ll do the same 
things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we&#39;ll deal with you 
agitators.&#34; And so on. More of them said, &#34;Have Seidov himself come.&#34; This 
went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us 
out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because 
they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The 
smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who 
had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a 
club that didn&#39;t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay 
to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day 
someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.
Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie 
theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn&#39;t sit or lie down, it 
was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants 
took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in 
Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to 
mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting 
right and left. I just don&#39;t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only 
the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women 
were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come 
any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered 
together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie 
theater and there wouldn&#39;t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to 
the attic. I didn&#39;t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and 
couldn&#39;t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently 
they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the
theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn&#39;t. I was in no condition to open my 
eyes.

Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, &#34;Aren&#39;t you an 
Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you&#39;re an Azerbaijani.&#34; They
led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their
passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did
not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in 
nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like
they should have, with their IDs.

So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On
Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn&#39;t 
spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,
they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered 
the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-
in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only 
the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, 
she ran away, the neighbors wouldn&#39;t take her in, so she ran about the 
building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. 
This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were 
already in the city.

They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire 
families. They say they didn&#39;t even know for sure if the people were Armenians
or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I&#39;m not sure myself, I didn&#39;t 
see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it&#39;s very difficult 
now to say exactly who died and who didn&#39;t. It was very difficult to identify 
the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in
gasoline and burned . . . it&#39;s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard 
that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, 
including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in
Microdistrict 3.

They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who 
had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were 
going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply 
savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did 
what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that 
hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians
out and killed them on the spot. I didn&#39;t see it myself, but I heard that they
put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from 
the corpses, well you can&#39;t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the 
ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira
G., if I&#39;m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and 
she still can&#39;t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and 
beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that 
whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and 
carried her to the city. I still can&#39;t imagine how he managed to do that.

I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of 
people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a 
song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has 
that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, 
the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They 
couldn&#39;t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone&#39;s apartment and
called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,
she couldn&#39;t remember anyone&#39;s face.

I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had 
talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked
out of my head. I can&#39;t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw
the Secretary of the Directorate&#39;s Party organization, where Marina works. She
goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at
the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I&#39;m the 
Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met 
with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint 
meetings. I know them all, I&#39;ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from
Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of 
those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.

They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the
Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-
tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They
showed me the people who were in our apartment, they&#39;re working on our
case, but I can&#39;t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were
the ones, they&#39;re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that
someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were 
dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch 
me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these 
people, all of them, as much as I&#39;ve heard about them and seen them, they were
all from Kafan.

The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was 
there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn&#39;t 
recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since
I told him, &#34;Listen, you do something, because you know me.&#34; He turned away 
and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn&#39;t see Marina 
anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn&#39;t make out 
anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became 
myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people 
there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his 
name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one 
we&#39;re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, &#34;If
he&#39;s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his 
alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I&#39;m crazy, not 
responsible for my words.&#34; He said, &#34;What did they do to you, how awful, 
myself, I hid an Armenian family.&#34; Then after some time goes by he comes back 
again and says something entirely different: &#34;I wasn&#39;t at home, my family and 
I went to Baku.&#34; I said, &#34;Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally
different before.&#34; After that I didn&#39;t go to see our Procurator, our case is 
being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me 
that Rzayev&#39;s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. 
What are they doing with Rzayev?
Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the 
head I can&#39;t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an 
insult if he was in our apartment and doesn&#39;t have to pay for it, but at the 
same time

I&#39;m afraid to say I&#39;m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-
ter who I name, they tell me, no, you&#39;re wrong, he didn&#39;t do that, that one
wasn&#39;t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what
exactly I can&#39;t say.                                                     

When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn&#39;t see it, 
because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got
it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it 
always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my 
face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, 
they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he
works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, 
is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ 
dormitory is over there, that&#39;s where he lives. Now he&#39;s in custody, they even
have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the
clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our 
building was killed, it was that man.

A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that
he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn&#39;t come 
over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was 
all over, people started making announcements in town saying that 
investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now 
they&#39;ve caught him, everything&#39;s been proved. Now, evidently, they&#39;ve been
beating him, I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing with them over there, but he 
himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy 
came to the plant and said, &#34;Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the 
bus station on Saturday at ten.&#34; That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,
went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday
night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do 
you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, 
probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I&#39;m going to go. But they didn&#39;t
say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, 
because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had 
killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of 
that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that 
the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from

I&#39;ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I&#39;m satisfied with
them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word 
I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an 
Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don&#39;t know. 
His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from 
Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. 
His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani 
KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many 
photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at 
curfew, and I&#39;ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, 
the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off
and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a 
haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he 
is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don&#39;t know what he did, 
I can&#39;t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. 
At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there&#39;s no need for this, 
all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you&#39;re like a sister to me. I took a look
at him and thought, &#34;My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like 
you.&#34; But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything 
without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when 
she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over
the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the
balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had 
all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. 
They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that 
moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the 
faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the 
apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I&#39;ve got three kids and 
no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn&#39;t have 
anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the 
apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the 
apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That&#39;s what they said. How did they 
know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that
Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the 
building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis 
lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn&#39;t set fire to our 
apartment.

I don&#39;t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt 
when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would
have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but
probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw
that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at
a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were
being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have
been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from 
our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, &#34;Karina, we 
saw all of it, how could it happen?&#34; They&#39;re asking me! Well I just don&#39;t know
what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to 
me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn&#39;t have been 
able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani 
woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated 
woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two 
Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the
balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She 
came down to the entryway and said, &#34;You&#39;ll come in this entryway over my dead
body.&#34; So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some 
folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn&#39;t 
even know what they were doing. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. They knew very well
what they were doing if they didn&#39;t even lift a hand against that woman. They 
couldn&#39;t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani 
stopped them.

They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place 
they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the 
apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? 
Maybe I&#39;m losing my mind? But no, they&#39;re all chewing something. Maybe it is 
some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed 
to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had 
come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They
didn&#39;t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They 
screamed and screamed: &#34;Yeah, killing, killing, we&#39;re killing the Armenians!&#34; 
Only they didn&#39;t shout &#34;kill,&#34; they shouted &#34;gurun ermianlary.&#34; Gurun 
literally means &#34;kill,&#34; or &#34;destroy.&#34;

That&#39;s how it was! I&#39;ll continue. We hid in a captain&#39;s apartment, he&#39;s an
Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their 
kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part 
of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn&#39;t find
Lyuda she took Papa&#39;s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,
but they didn&#39;t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently
they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the
courage to . . .

A boy said to my mother &#34;Where&#39;s the gold?&#34; Mamma said he must have been 12 
to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the 
Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the 
fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where 
the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a 
little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn&#39;t really like to 
wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were 
bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma
thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and 
Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, 
bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had 
shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and 
tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having 
trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and 
started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted 
to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by 
accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, 
&#34;What&#39;s happened?&#34; He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, &#34;At least go and 
find out what&#39;s happening to my daughters, even if they&#39;ve burned them or 
murdered them, at least bring the corpses.&#34; He went looking for us. At that 
moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that 
someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn&#39;t get out 
from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought 
she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to 
herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from 
under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost
her mind. I&#39;ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that 
way to me, I&#39;ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled 
down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from
outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don&#39;t remember what order it
happened in.

And Mamma said, &#34;Listen, they&#39;re all running around down there, shouting 
something or other, and running toward the other building.&#34; It had more or 
less calmed down where we were. Who&#39;s dead, who&#39;s alive, we don&#39;t know. I 
tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, &#34;Listen;
let&#39;s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don&#39;t know how 
long we&#39;ll be here. Maybe they didn&#39;t burn everything.&#34; I don&#39;t get it, all
women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe 
not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, &#34;Mamma, what do you need any of that 
for? To hell with it! We&#39;re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!&#34; She
says, &#34;No, let&#39;s go get at least something. Maybe we&#39;ll leave here, spend the 
night at someone else&#39;s.&#34; Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son
Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were 
coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He 
shouts, &#34;Come back, they&#39;re coming!&#34; They didn&#39;t have enough time to get a 
lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my 
knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,
out of the hall . . . Someone took Father&#39;s old coveralls. The neighbor, his 
wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to 
leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and
just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, 
they&#39;re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, 
maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over
there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished 
building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more 
or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.

Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom
apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,
Asya Dallakian. She&#39;s an old woman, retired. She wasn&#39;t at home, at that
time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and
her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her
retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started
pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, 
something like that, she&#39;s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even 
live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and 
mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. 
They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, &#34;My 
God, what is going on around here? When will this end?&#34; We turned off the 
lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren&#39;t afraid, the ones who 
knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn&#39;t know, but 
they didn&#39;t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that 
he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his 
apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He&#39;s an exserviceman, retired, works up 
at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.
They tell him, &#34;Comrade Captain, don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t harm you, you&#39;re one of
us.&#34; He went upstairs, and they say, &#34;Aren&#39;t you taking anything from this 
apartment?&#34; He says, &#34;I don&#39;t need anything.&#34; And the women who were standing 
in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were 
standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the 
first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time 
to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty 
pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really 
mad, and he says, &#34;Where&#39;s the rug? I just put it right here!&#34; They tell him, 
&#34;Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.&#34; He ran off in that
direction.

Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, 
there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They 
just didn&#39;t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, 
she didn&#39;t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told 
me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, 
the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, &#34;Where&#39;s the girl who was here?&#34;
And he became furious. The woman tells him, &#34;She came to . . . &#34; She didn&#39;t
know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would
comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, &#34;She
came to and went to the basement.&#34; Now, our basement is full of water. So the 
whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took 
flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been 
standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there 
to get me. Then one of them said, &#34;There&#39;s so much water down there, she 
probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in 
the basement. That&#39;s it, we can leave, no problem!&#34; I didn&#39;t know that, and 
when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn&#39;t 
just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .

After that we of course didn&#39;t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really 
didn&#39;t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and 
started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. 
Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people 
who sat in their apartments and didn&#39;t help us at a time like that. I think 
that they could have helped! I don&#39;t think that they were obligated to, but 
they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole 
brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been
enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you&#39;re doing?&#34; That&#39;s 
all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not 
one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were 
standing on their balconies I didn&#39;t hear anyone&#39;s voice, no one said what are
you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women 
that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a
bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for 
one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, 
an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: 
if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed 
to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they
stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, &#34;If
you want to go on living, you&#39;ll disappear into your apartment.&#34; So she left.
That trick didn&#39;t work on them.

Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget 
that it happened. I said I&#39;d only forget it if I told them right then that it
had happened to their daughter--and if that didn&#39;t have any effect on them, 
then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. 
And no one did anything. Anything.

------------------------
GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian
without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.


(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing
will be discussed at the beginning - Note: I&#39;ve set all followups to sci.med
since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I&#39;m sure most of the
replies, if any, will be med-related.)




They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).
Oops, that is not a recognized &#34;illness&#34; in the psychological community,
better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)

Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians
will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,
just e-mail me and I&#39;ll send a summary file to you).  In the general
population, NT&#39;s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among
physicians it is much much higher (I don&#39;t know the exact percentage -
any help here a.p.p.er&#39;s?)

One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious
choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to
control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are
also extroverted, they are best described as &#34;Field Marshalls&#34;.  This trait
is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to
lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,
to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and
technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-
minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types
and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,
when the NT person has self-image challenges, the &#34;dark-side&#34; of this
personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.

A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their
temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),
and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient
must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I&#39;ve
known many M.D.&#39;s of this temperament and suffice to say I don&#39;t oblige them
with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they
usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an
extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).

Maybe we need more NF doctor&#39;s.  :^)

Enough on this subject - let&#39;s move on to candida bloom.



You&#39;ve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have
been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from &#39;anal retentivitis&#39;, but being
the phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people
myself in past posts.  Let&#39;s all try to raise the level of this discussion
above the level of anal effluent.



In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune
stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses
were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.
I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks
of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial
infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won&#39;t get into the
details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT&#39;s made this
diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the
difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed
a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you
understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal
therapy below).


The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor
mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being
considered &#39;systemic&#39; in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween
infection.



I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after
my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then
dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received
zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly
complex ways as my doctor explained (he&#39;s one of those &#39;evil&#39; orthomolecular
specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,
he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)
supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.
Call me carrot face.  :^)

Hopefully, Elaine&#39;s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to
all supplements.  I&#39;m even reevaluating some supplements I&#39;m taking, for
example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had
good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order
improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is
not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.



Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that
I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my
sinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that
demonstrate candida &#34;blooms&#34; in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation
(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one
week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this
time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on
Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered
normal).

BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can&#39;t
remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950&#39;s
which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)
aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus
inflammation symptoms.  I&#39;ll have to dig out that reference again since it
is relevant to this discussion.



My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic
response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.
Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow
part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a 
threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to
Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane
irritation due to the body&#39;s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,
one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a 
Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.

BTW, and I&#39;ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, &#34;Sinus Survival&#34;,
has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic
anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic
sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in
the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over
90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it
doesn&#39;t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection
is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He&#39;s also found that
nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.

This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is
aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway
into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by
direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,
lots of &#39;ifs&#39;, and &#39;implies&#39;, which doesn&#39;t please the hard-core NT who
has to have the double-blind study or it&#39;s a non-issue, but one has to start
with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.



This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
and reject any and all aspects of the &#39;yeast hypothesis&#39; until the
appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can&#39;t observe or culture
the yeast &#34;bloom&#34; in the gut or sinus, then there&#39;s no way to diagnose or
even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually
impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.

It&#39;s a real Catch-22.

Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the &#39;yeast hypothesis&#39; say that
no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it&#39;s not
up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which
should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should
be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to
convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,
you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to
compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study
needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get
funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I&#39;m very aware of this for the
smaller funded projects).  I&#39;m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other
doctors got together, pooled their practice&#39;s case histories and anecdotes
into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get
nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.

It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have
*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to
noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable
hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence
to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would
also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it&#39;s a done issue - 
excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will
not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold
such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...



Aren&#39;t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the
sinus mucus membranes and cilia?



Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus
species can grow hyphae (&#34;roots&#34;) into deep tissue, similar to mold growing
in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but
you can&#39;t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic
anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such
as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has
been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I&#39;ve been in
e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-
term treatment of GI tract &#34;candidiasis&#34;.  It&#39;s like trying to weed a garden
by cutting off what&#39;s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come
out again once you walk away.

The $60000 question is whether a contained candida &#34;bloom&#34; can partially
grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms
in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming &#34;systemic&#34; in the
classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive
bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that
is potentially lethal.



Also, if one is an &#39;anal retentive&#39;, like I&#39;ve been diagnosed in a prior
post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)



As I&#39;ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system
that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt
alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don&#39;t work.
For example, I went to three ENT&#39;s, who all said that I will just have to live
with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab&#39;s failed (they did mention
surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren&#39;t plugged and it would not
get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and
fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and
equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly
improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.
Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have
improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the
experience of the three ENT&#39;s I saw who said that I&#39;d just have to &#34;live with
it&#34;.  I&#39;m confident I will reach what one could call a total &#34;cure&#34;.  The
anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction
because of my overuse of ab&#39;s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those
having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.
Be sure to get the revised edition.)



Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his
visits to several ENT&#39;s totally floored him when they said &#34;you&#39;ll just have
to live with it&#34;.  He spent several years trying everything - standard and
non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now
shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road
to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a
systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of
anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own
practice.  I&#39;m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-
&#34;yeast hypothesis&#34; posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,
&#34;it&#39;s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases&#34;, to put it mildly.
I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating
their moral obligations to help the patient.

Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are
confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the &#34;hypothetical
yeast overgrowth&#34; (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people
have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues
have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -
you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does
something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a
thousand of his patients, shouldn&#39;t you at least sit up and take notice?
Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works
instead of why it shouldn&#39;t work.  I&#39;m afraid a lot of doctors have become
so enamored with &#34;scientific correctness&#34; that they are ignoring the patients
they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which
we don&#39;t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when
you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach
(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having
exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional
medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I
went to a couple of doctor&#39;s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,
and as a result I have found significant relief.

Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up
some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having
his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)
therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the
accepted therapies are ineffective?  I&#39;d like to hear a doctor tell me:
&#34;well, I&#39;ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this
country, and since they clearly don&#39;t work for you, I now have the authority
to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I
can&#39;t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign
something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of
these unproven therapies, and I&#39;ll have to register your case at the State
Board.&#34;  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would&#39;ve jumped on this
pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic
reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much
risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the
patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,
and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would
be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the
compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it&#39;s doing everything
it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism
that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of
which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all
(true quackery).

I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.



What dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper
working of the mucos memebranes?



I&#39;d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.



Brave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one
develops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have
backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune
system, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual
desensitization.  I now kind of like being called &#34;anal retentive&#34; - it has
a nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the
post - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might
even cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...



Thanks again for a great and informative post.  I hope others who have
researched this area and are lurking in the background will post their
thoughts as well, no matter their views on this subject.

   Born 1959

 Azerbaijan are false, as verified by independent International Human Rights
 organizations - DD]

I&#39;m thinking about the price the Sumgait Armenians paid to be living in
Armenia now. We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the
price was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide
our lives into &#34;before&#34; and &#39;&#39;after.&#34; We talk like that: that was before the
war. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole
epoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,
it will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even 
sharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now
. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those
inhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our
losses and everything that happened.

Nineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it
to pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would
be such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and 
those who didn&#39;t.

That second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you 
could already smell danger in the air. But we didn&#39;t think that the danger was
near and possible, so we didn&#39;t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as
my parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. 
My parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought
that they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.

In our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the
afternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all
our family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin
crawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel
like it&#39;s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our 
apartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in 
his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely 
locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We&#39;re known as a 
hospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people 
who were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends
of many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.

My parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my 
mother, &#34;Run to the kitchen for a knife.&#34; But Mother was detached, pale, as 
though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never 
expected it of her, she&#39;s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A 
girlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, 
&#34;No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you&#39;re not to come out 
of the bedroom. We&#39;re going to tell them that we&#39;re alone in the apartment.&#34;

We went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl 
crawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and
Karina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that 
perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside 
me. I&#39;m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to
embrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina 
was thinking the same thing, but she&#39;s quite reserved. We didn&#39;t have time to 
say anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. 
There was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from
excited voices. I couldn&#39;t figure what was going on out there because the door
to the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time
Karina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,
but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us 
immediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at 
least so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their 
eyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst
in, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn&#39;t see. They 
came into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other 
room. He didn&#39;t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma 
snatched the axe from behind and said, &#34;Tell them not to touch the children. 
Tell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.&#34; She
said this to Father in Armenian.

There were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They 
understood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don&#39;t know Armenian, 
they don&#39;t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: &#34;You and 
your children both . . . we&#39;re going to do the same thing to you and your 
children that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, 
our mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,&#34; and 
so on and so forth, &#34;and we came to do the same thing to you.&#34; This whole time
some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They 
were mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren&#39;t any older people 
among them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, 
all the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I&#39;m 
a teacher.

So they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took 
him in there, no they didn&#39;t take him in there, they dragged him in there,
because he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all 
but a crack. We couldn&#39;t see what was happening to Father, what they were 
doing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off 
Mamma&#39;s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: &#34;I&#39;m old enough to 
be your mother! What are you doing?!&#34; He struck her. Now he&#39;s being held, 
Mamma identified him. I hope he&#39;s convicted. Then they went after Karina, 
who&#39;s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying 
to lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their 
consciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they 
mustn&#39;t do it. She said, &#34;Come on, let&#39;s straighten this out, without 
emotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we 
ever do to you?&#34; Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come 
into our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and 
coming--said, &#34;What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We 
came here to kill them.&#34;

They pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she 
didn&#39;t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, &#34;What
did we do to you? What did we do to you?&#34; And even later, when she came to, 
she said, &#34;Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?&#34;

That group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only 
broke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they 
were beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain 
nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do 
was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they
did to her. That&#39;s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, 
they beat her savagely . . . It&#39;s really amazing that she not only lived, but 
didn&#39;t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they 
could to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, 
kicking her, using anything they could find.

Mamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn&#39;t feel any pain, 
just didn&#39;t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they 
did. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn&#39;t enough room in the
apartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the 
corners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, &#34;Let&#39;s take her 
outside.&#34;

Those beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they 
weren&#39;t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time 
I thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren&#39;t 
afraid of what would happen to them.

When they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered 
with blood--that&#39;s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several 
times from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though 
I were recording it all on film. I think I&#39;m a kind person by nature, but I&#39;m 
vengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don&#39;t deserve it. I hold 
a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time 
I would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I&#39;d remember them, 
and I&#39;ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me 
&#34;forget,&#34; you have to forget, you have to go on living.

At some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and 
despite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found
the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had
to do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering 
to an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that
he&#39;s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me
and took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over
me. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that
they planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up
with their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a 
really deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I 
suddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly 
I felt myself flying. I couldn&#39;t figure out if I was really flying or if I 
just imagined it. When I came to I thought now I&#39;m going to smash on the 
ground. And when it didn&#39;t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was 
still lying on the floor. And since I didn&#39;t scream, didn&#39;t beg them at all,
they became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with
their feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-
cially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.

I came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. 
Some people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn&#39;t 
need any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had 
even forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn&#39;t worth 
living.

There was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman 
pain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come 
because I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, 
and when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to
put an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The 
person who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, 
because he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he 
has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, 
one who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, 
even during the investigation he almost called me &#34;daughter,&#34; he apologized, 
although, of course, he knew that I&#39;d never forgive him. Something like that 
I can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my 
words, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person&#39;s shoes,
but then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never 
forget it.

I wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one 
could protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of 
beasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything.
I knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.

And Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a
couple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn&#39;t, so he tried to 
kill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an 
end to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into 
the other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don&#39;t know which one it 
was, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was 
thrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her 
and made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all 
the deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor 
from the Melkumians&#39; landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a 
little. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,
how we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He&#39;s a good person. He said, 
&#34;You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,
I, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,&#34; he
says, &#34;nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and 
think I never shall again.&#34; The door to his apartment was open and he saw 
everything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken 
the father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He 
saw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven
people. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the 
brothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that 
they were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to 
do something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I

After I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and 
Lyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn&#39;t even 
remember my sister&#39;s name. I wanted to cry &#34;Marina!&#34; out to her, but could
not. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn&#39;t
for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus
I saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had
told them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both
there by chance, that they weren&#39;t Armenians. Lyuda&#39;s a Russian, you can tell 
right away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that
she was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I&#39;m glad 
that at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . 
although her spirit was murdered . . .

At some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that 
mob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his 
name, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, &#34;Igor,
help!&#34; But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were 
taking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and 
Lyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the 
neighbors.

And the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, 
something like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.
 
Then they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, 
they were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out 
onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already 
sure that I was dead because I didn&#39;t react at all to the new blows. Someone 
said, &#34;She&#39;s already dead, let&#39;s throw her out.&#34; When they carried me out onto
the balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I 
heard someone say in Azerbaijani: &#34;Don&#39;t kill her, I know her, she&#39;s a 
teacher.&#34; I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can&#39;t remember
whose voice it was. It wasn&#39;t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an 
accent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks
Azerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and
threw me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and 	I having opened my 
eyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had 
been beaten so much that I didn&#39;t have the strength to remember him. I only 
remember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately 
I can&#39;t remember anything more.

What should I say about Igor? He didn&#39;t treat me badly. I had heard a lot 
about him, that he wasn&#39;t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too
much. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that 
women usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,
if he was wounded, then it&#39;s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated
very sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in 
Ufa, and was injured, but that&#39;s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that 
all out later.

Among the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary 
of the Party organization. I don&#39;t know his last name, his first name is 
Najaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn&#39;t so sure,
she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she 
didn&#39;t want to endanger him. She said, &#34;He was there,&#34; and a little while 
later, &#34;Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. 
No, it seems like it was he.&#34; I am sure it was he because when he came to see 
us the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something 
entirely different. The investigators haven&#39;t summoned him yet. He came to see
us in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought 
groceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started 
crying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don&#39;t know if he was putting 
us on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned 
him to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn&#39;t in Sumgait. 
The fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is 
right, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don&#39;t know how the 
investigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was
told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn&#39;t he have gone 
to Baku and arranged an alibi? I&#39;m not ruling out that possibility.

Ill now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she 
bought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her 
wedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband&#39;s 
lives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A 
Russian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He&#39;s an orphan who was raised by
his grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a 
special school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I&#39;ll say this--I&#39;m 
a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that
boy is not at all mentally handicapped. He&#39;s healthy, he can think just fine, 
and analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he&#39;s cunning, too. 
After that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.

He beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, &#34;Lady, if you give us all the gold 
and money in your apartment we&#39;ll let you live.&#34; And Mamma told them where 
the gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and 
everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other 
over and taking the gold from one another. I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t kill one 
another right then.

Mamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was
black and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she 
ran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his
mouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-
low. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn&#39;t walk; like me, he was half dead, 
halfway into the other world. He couldn&#39;t comprehend anything, couldn&#39;t see, 
and was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, 
it was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.

The bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father 
out of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,
a small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people 
were standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, 
everywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee
service--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, &#34;I was afraid 
to turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the 
threshold I couldn&#39;t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and 
dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors&#39;.&#34; Mamma remembered one of the 
criminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, 
out of one eye. She says, &#34;I realized that my death would come from that 
person. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.&#34;
Later they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.

I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina 
was already outside, I didn&#39;t know what they were doing to her. I was left all
alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even
though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and
Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.
I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. 
But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones 
I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the 
ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and 
that all of that would die with me.

At some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I 
didn&#39;t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that
we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, &#34;Neighbor, is that
you?&#34; In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived
I would remember him. That&#39;s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been 
taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to 
take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he
had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he 
started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. 
The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor&#39;s axe froze in 
the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the 
presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities 
or not. He said, &#34;Enough, let&#39;s go to the third entryway.&#34; In the third 
entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once 
again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as 
they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they 
found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had 
already taken the other.

Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn&#39;t obey their general. They
had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over
those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I 
identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an 
Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:
&#34;Sister, don&#39;t be afraid, I&#39;ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.&#34;
That&#39;s just what he said, &#34;those Azerbaijanis,&#34; as though he himself were not 
Azerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, &#34;I&#39;ll drive
them out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails
and nail the door shut, because they&#39;ll be coming back from Apartment 41.&#34; 
That&#39;s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the 
person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened 
to, the &#34;general,&#34; said that they were going to the third entryway.

Kuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn&#39;t do it by myself. 
Marina&#39;s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I
was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. 
He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. 
But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.

I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt 
from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find 
anything. He told me, &#34;Well, fine, I won&#39;t leave you here. Would any of the 
neighbors let you in? They&#39;ll be back, they won&#39;t calm down, they know you&#39;re 
alive.&#34; He told me all this in Armenian.

Then he returned to the others and said, &#34;What are you waiting for? Leave!&#34; 
They said, &#34;Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her 
yourself. No, we want to do it to.&#34; He urged them on, but gently, not 
coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just
boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went
down to the third floor with them himself, and said, &#34;Leave. What&#39;s the mat-
ter, aren&#39;t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?&#34; And
he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that 
he couldn&#39;t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I 
told him at the neighbors&#39; on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really
good terms with them.

We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman 
opened the door and immediately said, &#34;I&#39;m an Azerbaijani.&#34; He said, &#34;I know. 
Let her sit at your place a while. Don&#39;t open the door to anyone, no one knows
about this, I won&#39;t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.&#34; She says, &#34;Fine,
have her come in.&#34; I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I 
had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into 
tears. Even though I was wearing Marina&#39;s old fur coat, it&#39;s a short one, a 
half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, &#34;Do you know where my family 
is, what happened to them?&#34; She says, &#34;No, I don&#39;t know anything. I&#39;m afraid 
to go out of the apartment, now they&#39;re so wild that they don&#39;t look to see 
who&#39;s Azerbaijani and who&#39;s Armenian.&#34; Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my 
neighbor says, &#34;You know, Lyuda, I don&#39;t want to lose my life because of you, 
or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.&#34; During the butchery in our
apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl
earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was 
still there. When I&#39;m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I 
touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it
to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.

I went out and didn&#39;t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I 
don&#39;t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I 
end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the 
apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. 
I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had 
hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near 
some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. 
Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I 
think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were
broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay 
there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town 
could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that&#39;s what saved me. They were 
burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started
picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father&#39;s sport 
jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the
one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. 
And again I realized I wasn&#39;t getting out of there alive, and I started to 
strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on 
my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me
afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got 
burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone&#39;s hand was
protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn&#39;t know 
how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if 
I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I 
had never been so close to death and couldn&#39;t imagine how you could go on 
living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I 
thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda&#39;s place or someone is hiding her. 
I tried to think that Igor wouldn&#39;t let them be killed. He served in 
Afghanistan, he should protect her.

While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I
thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would 
she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among 
themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no
children&#39;s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. 
Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good 
job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was 
all over. They started to argue. A third one says, &#34;How come you get it? I 
have four children, and there are three rooms here, that&#39;s just what I need. 
All these years I&#39;ve been living in God-awful places.&#34; Another one says, 
&#34;Neither of you gets it. We&#39;ll set fire to it and leave.&#34; Then someone said 
that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their
place. And they, to my good fortune, didn&#39;t set fire to the apartment, and
left.

Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite 
frequently, &#34;Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let 
them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.&#34; Then they 
said, &#34;Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!&#34; They repeated it 
very often.

[After a small refresh Hasan got on the track again.]




   |&gt;    |&gt; I get the impression Hasan realized he goofed and is now
   |&gt;    |&gt; trying to drop the thread. Let him. It might save some
   |&gt;    |&gt; miniscule portion of his sorry face.

   |&gt;    Not really. since i am a logical person who likes furthering himself
   |&gt;    from any &#34;name calling&#34;, i started trashing any article that contains
   |&gt;    such abuses without responding to, and sometimes not even reading articles 
   |&gt;    written by those who acquired such bad habits from bad company!
   |&gt; 
   |&gt; Ah, but in my followup on the subject (which you, by the way, never bothered
   |&gt; responding to..) there was no name-calling. Hence the assumption.
   |&gt; Do you feel more up to it now, so that we might have an answer?
   |&gt; Or, to refresh your memory, does the human right issue in the area
   |&gt; apply to Palestinians only? Also, do you claim there is such a thing as 
   |&gt; forfeiting a human right? If that&#39;s possible, then explain to the rest of 
   |&gt; us how there can exist any such thing?
   |&gt; 
   |&gt; Use your logic, and convince us! This is your golden chance!

   |&gt; Jonas Flygare,


   well , ok. let&#39;s see what Master of Wisdom, Mr. Jonas Flygare,
   wrote that can be wisdomely responded to :

Are you calling names, or giving me a title? If the first, read your 
paragraph above, if not I accept the title, in order to let you get into the
um, well, debate again.



   |&gt; [hasan]

   |&gt; |&gt; [flax]

   |&gt; |&gt; |&gt; [hasan]

   |&gt; |&gt; |&gt;    In case you didNOT know, Palestineans were there for 18 months. 
   |&gt; |&gt; |&gt;    and they are coming back
   |&gt; |&gt; |&gt;    when you agree to give Palestineans their HUMAN-RIGHTS.

   |&gt; |&gt; |&gt;    Afterall, human rights areNOT negotiable.

   |&gt; |&gt; |&gt; Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t the right to one&#39;s life _also_
   |&gt; |&gt; |&gt; a &#39;human right&#39;?? Or does it only apply to palestinians?

   |&gt; |&gt; No. it is EVERYBODY&#39;s right. However, when a killer kills, then he is giving
   |&gt; |&gt; up -willingly or unwillingly - his life&#39;s right to the society. 
   |&gt; |&gt; the society represented by the goverment would exercise its duty by 
   |&gt; |&gt; depriving the killer off his life&#39;s right.

   |&gt; So then it&#39;s all right for Israel to kill the people who kill Israelis?
   |&gt; The old &#39;eye for an eye&#39; thinking? Funny, I thought modern legal systems
   |&gt; were made to counter exactly that.

   So what do you expect me to tell you to tell you, Master of Wsidom, 
							       ^^^
------------------------------------------------------------------
If you insist on giving me names/titles I did not ask for you could at
least spell them correctly. /sigh.

   when you are intentionally neglecting the MOST important fact that 
   the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is ILLEGITIMATE, 
   and hence ALL their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on 
   the ground of occupied territories.

No, I am _not_ neglecting that, I&#39;m merely asking you whether the existance
of Israeli citicens in the WB or in Gaza invalidates those individuals right
to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. We can get back to the 
question of which law should be used in the territories later. Also, you have 
not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.

   What do you expect me to tell you, Master of Wisdom, when I did explain my
   point in the post, that you &#34;responded to&#34;. The point is that since Israel 
   is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
   to the Occupied Palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic 
   deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.

If a state can deprive all it&#39;s citizens of human rights by its actions, then 
tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

   |&gt; |&gt; In conjugtion with the above, when a group of people occupies others 
   |&gt; |&gt; territories and rule them by force, then this group would be -willingly or 
   |&gt; |&gt; unwillingly- deprived from some of its rights. 

   |&gt; Such as the right to live? That&#39;s nice. The swedish government is a group
   |&gt; of people that rule me by force. Does that give me the right to kill
   |&gt; them?

   Do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?

Worthy or not, I was just applying your logic to a related problem.
Am I to assume you admit it wouldn&#39;t hold?

   |&gt; |&gt; What kind of rights and how much would be deprived is another issue?
   |&gt; |&gt; The answer is to be found in a certain system such as International law,
   |&gt; |&gt; US law, Israeli law ,...

   |&gt; And now it&#39;s very convenient to start using the legal system to prove a 
   |&gt; point.. Excuse me while I throw up.

   ok, Master of Wisdom is throwing up. 
   You people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !

Oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?
I&#39;ll let you in on a secret... It&#39;s not for real.. Take my word for it.

   |&gt; |&gt; It seems that the US law -represented by US State dept in this case-
   |&gt; |&gt; is looking to the other way around when violence occurs in occupied territories.
   |&gt; |&gt; Anyway, as for Hamas, then obviously they turned to the islamic system.

   |&gt; And which system do you propose we use to solve the ME problem?

   The question is NOT which system would solve the ME problem. Why ? because
   any system can solve it. 
   The laws of minister Sharon says kick Palestineans out of here (all palestine). 

I asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for 
all people involved. I assumed that was obvious, but I won&#39;t repeat that 
mistake. Now that I have straightened that out, I&#39;m eagerly awaiting your 
reply.

   Joseph Weitz (administrator responsible for Jewish colonization) 
   said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:
	   &#34;Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
	   peoples together in this country.... We shall not achieve our goal
						^^^                  ^^^
	   of being an independent people with the Arabs in this small country.
	   The only solution is a Palestine, at least Western Palestine (west of
	   the Jordan river) without Arabs.... And there is no other way than
	   to transfer the Arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to
	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be 
	   left.... Only after this transfer will the country be able to
	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. There is no other way out.&#34;
				   DAVAR, 29 September, 1967
				   (&#34;Courtesy&#34; of Marc Afifi)

Just a question: If we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
getting Israel out of ME one way or the other in both PLO covenant and HAMAS
charter (that&#39;s the english translations, if you have other information I&#39;d
be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to 
a _private_ paper even older? I&#39;m not going to get into the question if he
wrote the above, but it&#39;s fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
their share of fanatics. Guess what..? Those are not the people that will
make any lasting peace in the region. Ever. It&#39;s those who are willing to 
make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get 
something back.


   &#34;We&#34; and &#34;our&#34; either refers to Zionists or Jews (i donot know which). 

   Well, i can give you an answer, you Master of Wisdom, I will NOT suggest the 
   imperialist israeli system for solving the ME problem !

   I think that is fair enough .

No, that is _not_ an answer, since I asked for a system that could solve 
the problem. You said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.
Guess where that takes your logic? To never-never land. 


   &#34;The greatest problem of Zionism is Arab children&#34;.
			   -Rabbi Shoham.

Oh, and by the way, let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
a real bummer, when I try giving your posts any credit.

DEPOSITION OF YURI VAGARSHAKOVICH MUSAELIAN

   Born 1953
   Line Electrician
   Sumgait Streetcar and Trolleybus Administration

   Resident at Building 4/21, Apartment 29
   Block 14, Narimanov Street
   Sumgait [Azerbaijan]


I spent almost all of February doing overhaul. The 27th was a short day at
work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided
to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal
Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had
walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes
behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24
Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the 
car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,
and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn&#39;t have anything on her head, and 
her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They&#39;re 40 to 
45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help
them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?

When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn&#39;t see what it was, 
but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the 
Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle
around it. I ask, &#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34; Someone tells me, &#34;Come listen.&#34; Well
they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: &#34;Brother
Muslims, our time has come . . . &#34; and something else along that line. I
didn&#39;t understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to 
get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. 
New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And
the comments started: &#34;Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!&#34; and &#34;There&#39;s
no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.&#34; I even heard that: &#34;All 
Moscow is behind us.&#34; Well I watched and listened in and realized that this 
was no joke. I quietly left and went home.

Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, 
that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of 
things, but I didn&#39;t have any idea what was really going on.

My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt&#39;s house in Baku. 
I didn&#39;t say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two
o&#39;clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and 
shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,
like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a 
demonstration and move slowly.

My wife asks what&#39;s going on out there. I say I don&#39;t know. I put on some
outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd
people are shouting &#34;Down with the Armenians!&#34; and &#34;Death to the Armenians!&#34; I
waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street 
on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned 
and went against the traffic--it&#39;s one way there--down the Street of the 26 
Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there 
was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same 
kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside 
from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young
people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.

My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of
uneasy and said, &#34;No, let&#39;s stay at home instead.&#34; An hour went by, or maybe 
an hour and a half. Well, I wasn&#39;t keeping track of the time, I can&#39;t say
exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on
the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.

I put outside clothes on and went out again. There&#39;s noise, an uproar outside,
and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time 
there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more 
aggressive. No, I think, something&#39;s wrong here, this isn&#39;t any demonstration.
They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run 
again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I 
followed them. I was thinking I&#39;d just watch and see. Who knew where this was 
leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one 
side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square 
and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There 
was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.
I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. &#34;We don&#39;t need 
perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.&#34; Now what did they 
mean by &#34;living like we have been?&#34; The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. 
But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense 
of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just 
in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I&#39;ve never seen it 
anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.

Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians&#39; 
apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn&#39;t 
hear them say &#34;kill them&#34; over the microphone, I only heard &#34;beat them and 
drive them out.&#34; I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then
another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off
to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and 
I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.
There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn&#39;t see any of them try 
to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.

Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no
demonstration, and I had to protect my family.

I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next
to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-
lor&#39;s shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-
thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because
after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons
in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City 
Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I 
saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the 
cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 
to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried 
off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing
right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe 
about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. 
When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was 
about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He 
has a package in his hand, and he&#39;s pulling out anasha and handing it out. I 
have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I&#39;ve seen a lot of 
people smoke it, I&#39;ve seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled 
around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.

Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. 
I turned around and saw them running. Well I&#39;ll just keep on going like I am, 
I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. 
And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the 
street. He&#39;s a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, 
which had &#34;Ermeni oryum&#34; written on it in Azerbaijani, that means &#34;Death to 
Armenians!&#34; That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don&#39;t really
know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father&#39;s name is
Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark
blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His 
family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on 
Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; 
their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the 
left. Now Rafik&#39;s little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a 
new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son 
was carrying a flag that said &#34;Death to Armenians!&#34; I was surprised because 
before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being 
done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.

Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, &#34;It&#39;s OK, it&#39;ll pass, 
they&#39;re young kids, they&#39;ve just gotten all whooped up.&#34; Naturally I didn&#39;t 
want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And 
this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn&#39;t 
see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine&#39;s in motion. They weren&#39;t 
handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn&#39;t see people drinking 
and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn&#39;t unloaded the vodka and 
hashish to put in a store window!

So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one 
would stop them now, they weren&#39;t even trying, although, I&#39;ll say it again, 
the police were there, I saw them. And it&#39;s not just that the police weren&#39;t 
breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. 
True, at the time I couldn&#39;t even imagine that under our government, our much-
vaunted leadership--and I&#39;m not afraid to say these words: so many people 
died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I 
couldn&#39;t imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be 
specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of 
Sumgait, I couldn&#39;t imagine that such things could take place.

When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: &#34;Let&#39;s go upstairs.&#34; 
We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the 
evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.
I stopped at &#34;The Corner,&#34; a place called that right next to the bazaar. I 
look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to 
the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. 
The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed 
toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, 
wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as 
though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more 
noise, and the glass was flying again.

We spent the night at the neighbors&#39;. My apartment was on the first floor,
there was really no way to defend yourself there.

In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. 
On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or 
what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the 
bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying 
there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing
you couldn&#39;t even see him.

That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

Tony-

While I honestly believe you believe you are doing a &#34;good thing&#34; by posting
that piece of propaganda, I believe the more people believe that the more they
will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people.  I
have seen the film called &#34;The Gay Agenda&#34; and along with my church we found
it to be horrifying.  Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of
editting can create any image one wants to portray), rather becaseu we are familia
familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people
are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither
you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay, but knowing as
many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life
I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report, something
obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are
innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an
abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not
support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian
Fundamentalist extremists, but I know people who are not the sexual deviants
your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed
homosexuality from it&#39;s list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that
there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.
I do not feel threatened by gays, I don&#39;t understand why others are.

The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-
istries:  Exodus International &amp; Homosexuals Anonymous.

THE FOUNDER OF AN &#34;EX-GAY&#34; SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO

by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)

In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate&#39;s homophobia rewaa
awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE
INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians &#34;a way out of the homosexual death-style&#34;
through prayer.  &#34;I&#39;d like to give the award back,&#34; Caligiuri now laughs, &#34;I&#39;m
no longer deserve it.&#34;
  Caligiuri&#39;s eight year involvement with the national &#34;ex-gay&#34; movement peaked
with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well
as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  &#34;There&#39;s no reality
in it,&#34; he says, &#34;I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.&#34;
  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the
organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again
Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who
are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  &#34;We offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,&#34; explains Bob Davies, director of
Exodus.  He ventures that &#34;about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-
sexuality are men.&#34;
  &#34;Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time,&#34; says Lisa Seeley, a former &#34;redeemed lesbian&#34; who worked with
Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  &#34;These
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.&#34;
  &#34;It&#39;s possible to change your identity or your behavior,&#34; says sex educator
Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. &#34;But it&#39;s really impossible to
change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,
but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.&#34;
  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all
hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar.  &#34;I was really drunk,&#34; he recalls, &#34;and I
went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all
night, and the next morning he raped me again.&#34;
  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex-lover.  &#34;He had another man there with him,&#34;
Caligiuri recalls.  &#34;I thought at this time, &#39;If this is what being gay is
about, I don&#39;t want to be this way anymore.&#34;
  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery
with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix&#39;s
gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its
first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,
Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell.
  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  &#34;We were listed
under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,&#34; Caligiuri says, &#34;so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out
where the local bars were, and we&#39;d preach to them about the sins of homo-
sexuality.&#34;  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,
adding, &#34;They&#39;ll do anything to reach these people.&#34;
  &#34;David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,&#34; recalls Peter
Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix&#39;s Catholic diocese AIDS program, &#34;like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.&#34;
  Caligiuri&#39;s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
Raphael&#39;s syndicated talk show in 1985.  &#34;They were relieved,&#34; he recalls.
&#34;They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better
that I should be a &#39;reformed&#39; gay person.&#34;
  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  &#34;By the time I appeared on Sally&#39;s
show,&#34; &#34;I&#39;d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their
father.  I was horny all the time.&#34;
  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he &#34;used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs.&#34;  When he wasn&#39;t working the bookstores, he was sleeping
with other &#34;reformed&#34; homosexuals.
  &#34;I didn&#39;t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex
with one another,&#34; Caligiuri says.  &#34;We&#39;d go to conferences in other cities,
and we&#39;d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody
else.&#34;
  By the time he appeared on &#39;AM Philadelphia&#39; television show in May 1988,
Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show&#39;s
host asked him if he ever &#34;acted on temptation,&#34; his answer was a lie.
  Caligiuri&#39;s duplicity began to take it&#39;s toll on him, however.  He was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating
yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  &#34;I was too sick
to go to church,&#34; he explains.  &#34;The more time I spent away from those people
the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.&#34;
  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry&#39;s doors.  &#34;I&#39;d convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex-gay people,&#34; he says.
  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (&#34;I&#39;m interest-
ed in belief systems that aren&#39;t judgemental.&#34;), considering romance (&#34;But
not with a CHristian!&#34;), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.
&#34;I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,&#34; he says.  &#34;I want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I
may have brought to our community.&#34;

---end article---

Caligiuri&#39;s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of &#39;ex-gay&#39; ministries who have said very similar th
similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have
come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,
like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian &#34;Lazarus Project&#34; of West
Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as &#34;Love In
Action&#34; and others, who either once claimed to have been &#34;reformed&#34; or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed
in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of &#34;sealing&#34; their
new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses
and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous &#34;sin&#34;
through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also
mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them, they may even opt for &#39;suicide&#39; or surgical dampering of the brain
functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-
place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington&#39;s
_&#34;Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
Maury Johnston&#39;s _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser&#39;s _Come Hom!_.  I
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
self-acceptance.
------------------------
&lt;-&gt; &gt; But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large
&lt;-&gt; &gt; group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people
&lt;-&gt; &gt; every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can
&lt;-&gt; &gt; be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it 
&lt;-&gt; &gt; requires a continually standing committee of organizers.  
&lt;-&gt; 
&lt;-&gt; Again, my response is, &#34;so what?&#34;  Is Mr. Rutledge arguing that since
&lt;-&gt; the local and federal governments have abandoned their charter to support
&lt;-&gt; such activity, and passed laws prohibiting private organizations from 
&lt;-&gt; doing so, that they have eliminated the basis for the RKBA?   On the
&lt;-&gt; contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.
&lt;
&lt;No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was &#34;a little bit
&lt;and an anachronism.&#34;  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are
&lt;an anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the 
&lt;people.  These representatives of the people have already decided
&lt;that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some
&lt;cases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional 
&lt;interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority
&lt;of the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example
&lt;of the people using their power of government.  If this is not
&lt;how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.

Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the
people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are
there to prevent a &#39;tyrrany of the majority&#39;.  For example, a majority
could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.
and it would fly using the logic above.

When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,
there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis
is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those
who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a
majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting
the hangee.

What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the
limitations on the government, probably because they know that the
people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind
tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has
been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just
shows how gullible the people have become to &#34;I am from the government
and am here to help you sort of line&#34;.  We have been lied to, fed
half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control
laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on
force, pure and simple.  Do you REALLY want the government to be able
to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch
of elitists (congresscritters)?  I sure don&#39;t.  The Founding Fathers
sure as hell didn&#39;t, either.

&lt;&gt; Mox nix, Mr. Rutledge.  YOU are the only one here claiming that the
&lt;-&gt; RKBA is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated
&lt;-&gt; militia.  Why this is a false assumption has already been posted a 
&lt;-&gt; number of times.  
&lt;
&lt;No, I simple stated that the people have a right to &#34;join a well
&lt;organized militia.&#34;  And I have also stated that a militia that
&lt;meets once or twice a year is clearly &#34;well organized.&#34;  And this
&lt;state of readiness that I have claimed the people have a &#34;right&#34;
&lt;to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated
&lt;by Hamilton. 

You better read the Senate Subcommitte on the Constitution regarding the
Second Amendment, and a linguist&#39;s analisys of the Second itself.
IN the meanwhile, show us some stuff to back up your assertions.
And yes, I have the above mentioned documents (and more) online.

Topic 1:
window problem using server application screen display motif manager running
I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to 
override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am 
using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be 
working with Open Look in the future.

     What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
user from switching from one window of the application to 
another window.  Let&#39;s say, for example, that Window A is on top 
of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks 
the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the 
window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain 
circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to 
beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window 
A.

      From the research and testing I&#39;ve done so far, it appears that 
this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this 
case Motif.  I haven&#39;t found any way to override this default 
processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell 
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
notify events, but I can&#39;t find any way to tell Motif not to make the 
switch.

      The temporary solution I&#39;ve currently come up with is very 
kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch 
in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force 
the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call 
and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary 
functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places 
twice.

      Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any* 
window manager) when I don&#39;t want the window order switch to 
actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this 
newsgroup.

Cheers....     Randall

	window = XCreateWindow(...);
	XSetTransientForHint(display, window, window);
	XMapWindow(...);
------------------------

   Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don&#39;t do it. They place the title at that position
   and the window at a position below it.

   This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
   configuration and restore is later.

   Currently, my solution is:

	   XCreateWindow(...);
	   XSetWMProperties(..);
	   XMapWindow(...);
	   XFlush(...);
	   XMoveWindow(...);


   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering
   if I&#39;m overlooking something obvious.

   Richard.


I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the &#34;user&#34; window. Maybe other window managers
have similar options.
Another way to figure out the difference between the &#34;user&#34; window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.
------------------------


As I&#39;ve said before, there&#39;s no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can&#39;t assume that the window you&#39;re parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree&#39;s until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there&#39;s no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

------------------------

The problem was that SunPost411Ld was not defined.
------------------------
A colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new MIPS workstation.
When he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running.  In this configuration, X windows
applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a
second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,
giving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.

   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier
colours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL
X applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different
font (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available, so there doesn&#39;t appear to be a problem in the font
directories/hash-tables.

   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?
------------------------
I have the following problem on X11R5 servers.

When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has
the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.

Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose
event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window
that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.

When ExposureMask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly
updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application
gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.

Everything works fine with X11R4.

Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)?
Is it something I do wrong?
Is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)?
Is this a bug in X11 release 5?

Greetings,

Consumer Reports once wrote about the S-10 Blazer that it &#34;shook and rattled
like a tired taxi cab&#34;.  There is one noise that is expecially irritating -
the back window squeaks.  I believe its because the whole tailgate assembly
and window are not solid.  Anyway, has anyone had the same problem, and have
you found any fixes?
------------------------
: &gt; The application creates window with a button &#34;Quit&#34; and &#34;Press me&#34;.
: &gt; The button &#34;Press me&#34; pops up a dialog box. The strange feature of
: &gt; this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
: &gt; first time. If I try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), 
: &gt; it is *much* slower.
: 
: The shell is waiting for the window-manager to respond to its
: positioning request.  The window-manager is not responding because
: it thinks the window is already in the right place.
: 
: Exactly *why* the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
: me; all information greatly received.

Thanks for this clue, and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the
same direction.

One solution, due to Derek Ho: when the popup is popped up, we SetValue
its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue
first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different.
The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the
location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the
source of the problem.)

The solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:

1) Use &#34;twm&#34; or &#34;mwm&#34; rather than &#34;olwm&#34;
2) Use &#34;olwm&#34;, with resource &#34;*wmTimeout: 10&#34;
3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.

This is obviously working around some bug somewhere.
------------------------
Usually when I start up an application, I first get the window outline
on my display. I then have to click on the mouse button to actually
place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry 
option the window appears right away, the properties specified by
the -geometry argument. The question now is:

How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify
window position with a mouseclick? I&#39;ve tried explicitly setting window
size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

Thanks for any hints

First of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.
The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but &#34;(at best) 
second-hand&#34;.

	&#34;And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching
	 Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and
	 he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, &#34;Saul, Saul,
	 why are you persecuting Me?&#34;  And he said, &#34;Who art Thou, Lord?&#34;  And
	 He said, &#34;I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .&#34;
		(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)

Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He
became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were 
followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.


I agree.  I don&#39;t believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you 
the Spirit exists.  Please don&#39;t complain about this being circular.  I know
it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?
(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)


The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?
The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as &#34;inspired by God&#34;, 
literally means &#34;God-breathed&#34;.  In other words, God spoke the actual words 
into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is 
one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and 
incompleteness of &#34;inspired by God&#34;.


That&#39;s what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a 
book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks 
of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.



What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior
historicity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus&#39; writings, or the writings 
of the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.


Jesus was fully God as well.  That&#39;s why I&#39;d assert that he is wise.


Please rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your
current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not
only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards
to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?
	In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based
on gut feelings about the text and other scholars&#39; unsubstantiated claims.  
The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.
	About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the
writers, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the 
least without the Spirit&#39;s guidance:

	&#34;For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit 
	searches all things, even the depths of God.&#34;  (1 Cor 2:10, NAS)
 
Peace and may God guide us in wisdom.

These laws written for the Israelites, God&#39;s chosen people whom God had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a
direct witness to God&#39;s existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable.
Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
God&#39;s chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the
age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is
repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just
for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew and Gentile
alike.

God be with you,

ra&gt; In article &lt;C5ELp2.L0C@acsu.buffalo.edu&gt;,
ra&gt;
ra&gt; &gt;     Well, Jason, it&#39;s heretical in a few ways. The first point is that
ra&gt; &gt;     this equates Lucifer and Jesus as being the same type of being.
ra&gt; &gt;     However, Lucifer is a created being: &#34;Thou [wast] perfect in thy
ra&gt; &gt;     ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in
ra&gt; &gt;     thee.&#34; (Ezekiel 28:15). While Jesus is uncreated, and the Creator of
ra&gt; &gt;     all things: &#34;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
ra&gt; &gt;     God, and the Word was God.  The same was in the beginning with God.
ra&gt; &gt;     All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made
ra&gt; &gt;     that was made.&#34; (John 1:1-3) &#34;And he is before all things, and by
ra&gt; &gt;     him all things consist.&#34; (Colossians 1:17)
ra&gt;
ra&gt;    Your inference from the Ezekiel and John passages that Lucifer was
ra&gt; &#34;created&#34; and that Jesus was not depends on a particular interpetation of
ra&gt; the word &#34;create&#34; -- one with which many Christians may not agree.
ra&gt; Granted the Mormon belief that all of God&#39;s children (including Christ
ra&gt; and Lucifer) are eternally existent intelligences which were &#34;organized&#34;
ra&gt; into spirit children by God, the term &#34;creation&#34; can apply equally well
ra&gt; to both of those passages.

     Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to
     differing interpretations of &#34;create,&#34; and say that many Christians may
     not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith
     on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is
     truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
     and eternally existent are equivalent, you say &#34;granted the Mormon
     belief...&#34; You can&#39;t grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
     have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address
     and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
     conclusion that you grant.

     The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus
     is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
     belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.

ra&gt; &gt;     Your point that we all are brothers of Jesus and Lucifer is also
ra&gt; &gt;     heretical, since we are not innately brothers and sisters of Christ.
ra&gt; &gt;     We are adopted, &#34;For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
ra&gt; &gt;     again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby
ra&gt; &gt;     we cry, Abba, Father.&#34; (Romans 8:15); and not the natural children
ra&gt; &gt;     of God. It is only through faith that we even enter the family of
ra&gt; &gt;     God; &#34;For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.&#34;
ra&gt; &gt;     (Galatians 3:26). And it is only through the manifestation of this
ra&gt; &gt;     faith in receiving Jesus that we are become the sons of God.  &#34;But
ra&gt; &gt;     as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of
ra&gt; &gt;     God, [even] to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not
ra&gt; &gt;     of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but
ra&gt; &gt;     of God.&#34; (John 1:12-13)
ra&gt;
ra&gt;    Has it occured to you, Robert, that being &#34;born of&#34; someone or being
ra&gt; of that person (or Person)&#39;s &#34;family&#34; may be a symbolic term in the New
ra&gt; Testament?  Mormons believe that we are &#34;adopted&#34; into the House of
ra&gt; Israel through baptism and faith in Christ, although some have expressed
ra&gt; belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies.

     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is
     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible
     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:

          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the 
          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
          (Matthew 13:38)

          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which 
          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)

          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not 
          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said 
          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I 
          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he 
          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye 
          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the 
          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the 
          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in 
          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a 
          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)

          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of 
          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease 
          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)

          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit 
          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)

          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the 
          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he 
          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)

     One becomes a child of God...

          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)

          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us
          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,
          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
          is. (1 John 3:1-2)

     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:

          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)

          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
          (Ephesians 1:5)

          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)

          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)

          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)

          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
          begotten of him. (1 John 5:1)

          For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
          (Galatians 3:26)

ra&gt; &gt;     We are told that, &#34;And this is life eternal, that they might know
ra&gt; &gt;     thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&#34;
ra&gt; &gt;     (John 17:3). Life eternal is to know the only true God. Yet the
ra&gt; &gt;     doctrines of the LDS that I have mentioned portray a vastly
ra&gt; &gt;     different Jesus, a Jesus that cannot be reconciled with the Jesus of
ra&gt; &gt;     the Bible. They are so far removed from each other that to proclaim
ra&gt; &gt;     one as being true denies the other from being true. According to the
ra&gt; &gt;     Bible, eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true God, and
ra&gt; &gt;     not the construct of imagination.
ra&gt;
ra&gt;
ra&gt;    Robert, with all due respect, who died and left you Chief Arbiter of
ra&gt; Correct Biblical Interpretation?  I don&#39;t mean to be snotty about this,
ra&gt; but the fact is that the Bible is so differently interpreted by different
ra&gt; groups of Biblical scholars (what do you think of the Jehovah&#39;s
ra&gt; Witnesses, for example?) that to make reference to the &#34;Jesus of the
ra&gt; Bible&#34; is simply ridiculous.  Whose &#34;Jesus of the Bible&#34; do you mean?

     This is really a red herring. It doesn&#39;t address any issue raised, but 
     rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read 
     something into the Bible, doesn&#39;t change what the Bible teaches. For 
     example, the fact that the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ 
     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ &#34;Looking for that blessed hope,
     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
     Christ;&#34; (Titus 2:13),&#34;Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus
     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through
     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:&#34; (2 Peter 1:1)] 
     on the Deity of Christ.

     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not 
     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that 
     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, 
     you have to look at the Bible.

ra&gt; &gt;     &#34;Our Lord&#39;s mortality was essential to his own salvation&#34; (_The
ra&gt; &gt;     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), &#34;He had to work out his own salvation by
ra&gt; &gt;     doing the will of the Father in all things&#34; (ibid., p.54), &#34;he had
ra&gt; &gt;     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom&#34; (_Mormon
ra&gt; &gt;     Doctrine_, p.71).
ra&gt;
ra&gt;    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.  The
ra&gt; above books are by the late Bruce R. McConkie, a former general authority
ra&gt; of the LDS Church.  Those books were not published by the Church, nor do
ra&gt; they constitute &#34;offical doctrine.&#34;  They consist of his opinions.  Now,
ra&gt; does that mean that what he says is not true?  Not at all; I&#39;ll have to
ra&gt; think about the idea of Christ&#39;s personal salvation before I come to any
ra&gt; conclusions myself.  The conclusions I come to may seem &#34;heretical&#34; to
ra&gt; you, but I&#39;m prepared to accept that.

     I find this rather curious. When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is
     that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late
     apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the
     issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.&#39; Rick comes the closest with his &#34;I
     have my own conclusions&#34; to addressing the point.

     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of
     Bruce McConkie and whether his views were &#39;official doctrine.&#39; I don&#39;t
     think that it matters if McConkie&#39;s views were canon. That is not the
     issue.  Were McConkie&#39;s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
     subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may 
     certainly be.

------------------------

I finished reading a very good book, &#34;The Will of God&#34;, Weatherhead.
This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the
will of God.

Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts;
intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He
(Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael
Parkin above quite nicely.

Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God&#39;s ultimate will
is never to be defeated.  God&#39;s intentions may be interfered with,
even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by
circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all
humankind) will never be stopped.

Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of
this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God&#39;s
intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life
and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and
deviousness of humankind frustrated God&#39;s intent for His Son.  3)
Despite the circumstance, God&#39;s ultimate will was revealed in the
Cross, as Jesus willingly (&#34;not my will, Lord, but yours&#34;) died for
the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant,
overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.


It was not the intentional will of God.  It was the circumstancial
will, thus enabling the victory of the ultimate will.



Right, intentional will.

(Just like the Jewish people

We know neither the time nor the place.  He will return as a thief in the night.

Peace.

This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this 
doctrine:


                        THE DOCTRINE OF GOD


I.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD
     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most
     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. 
     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should
     be to know God.
     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three
     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the
     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I
     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in
     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each
     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also
     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.
     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.

II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.
     A.  God&#39;s nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for
         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and
         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without
         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.
     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.
     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.
         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,
         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;
         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.
     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely
         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of
         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.
         6:3.
     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time
         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all
         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,
         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with
         unlimited power over all creation).
         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It
         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day
         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our
         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the
         Lord&#39;s work needs to be God-centered, and that the
         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign
         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives
         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes
         regarding salvation.

III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.
     A.  In creation
          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in
          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining
          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs
          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end
          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;
          Heb. 1:3.
     B.  In salvation
         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is
         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. 
         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,
         active in salvation.
         1.  God, the Father
             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the
             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would
             be salvation, the conditions under which people
             could and would be saved, and even who would be
             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in
             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph
             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.
         2.  Christ, the Son of God
             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the
             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two
             important works:
             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of
                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.
             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the
                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on
                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by
                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The
                  work of salvation will be completed for us when
                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-
                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.
         3.  The Holy Spirit
             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is
             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is
             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the
             following ways:
             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11
             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new
                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.
             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work
                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.
             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making 
                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.
             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of
                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13
             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of
                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.
             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of 
                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12
             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.
             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  
                  Cf. Acts 1:8

------------------------
I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a
bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I&#39;d share it with all of you
anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might
benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.
 
=======================================================================
 
                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?
 
 
Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,
   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, &#34;God Loves You.&#34;  Isn&#39;t
   that true?
 
A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read
   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:
 
      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten
      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but
      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16
 
 
      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he
      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9
 
      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6
 
 
Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good
   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How
   can these verses apply to me?
 
A. By  God&#39;s  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is
   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The
   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.
   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before
   God.
 
      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There
      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after
      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11
 
      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately
      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9
 
 
Q. If I am such a wicked person in God&#39;s sight, what will God do to me?
 
A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will
   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.
 
      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,
      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap
      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They
      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of
      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24
 
 
Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not
   that bad.
 
A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-
   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible
   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal
   and consists of perpetual suffering.
 
      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was
      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15
 
      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall
      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and
      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50
 
      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them
      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting
      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory
      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9
 
 
Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?
 
A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be
   accountable to God for his actions.  God&#39;s perfect  justice  demands
   payment for sin.
 
      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23
 
      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;
      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,
      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10
 
      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
                                                       Matthew 12:36
 
 
Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought
   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?
 
A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our
   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our
   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus
   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.
 
      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of
      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6
 
      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;
      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5
 
      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also
      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the
      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the
      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4
 
      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that
      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21
 
 
Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was
   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about
   Hell anymore?
 
A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it
   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.
   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.
 
      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he
      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath
      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36
 
 
Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that
   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to
   Hell?
 
A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our
   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole
   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to
   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins
   and serve Christ as our Lord.
 
      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and
      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
                                                        Matthew 6:24
 
      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the
      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19
 
 
Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except
   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their
   followers also go to Hell?
 
A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-
   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other
   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their
   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and
   save us.
 
      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none
      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be
      saved.                                               Acts 4:12
 
 
      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the
      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6
 
      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
                                                          1 John 1:9
 
 
Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?
 
A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You
   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see
   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.
 
      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much
      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,
      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13
 
      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe
      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...
                                                       Acts 16:30-31
 
 
Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?
 
A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He
   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that
   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.
 
      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of
      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8
 
   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,
   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you
   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is
   the only Word of God.
   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented
   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.
 
      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of
      God.                                              Romans 10:17
 
 
Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?
 
A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging
   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.
 
      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a
      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17
 
   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin
   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we
   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins
   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to
   Hell.
 
      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him
      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his
      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26
 
 
Q. Doesn&#39;t  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be
   baptized?  Will these save me?
 
A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.
   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God&#39;s
   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-
   ure.  Salvation is
 
      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9
 
 
Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?
 
A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed
   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-
   more.
 
      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:
      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are
      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the
      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be
      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17
 
 
Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?
 
A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens
   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-
   more.
 
      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and
      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...
      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new
      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13
 
 
Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will
   come?
 
A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to
   save.
 
      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end
      come.                                            Matthew 24:14
 
 
Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?
 
A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing
   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the
   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not
   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the
   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be
   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.
 
      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden
      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with
      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3
 
      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his
      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7
 
 
Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.
 
A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to
   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.
 
      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&#39;s journey, and he
      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be
      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4
 
 
Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?
 
A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented
   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.
 
      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry
      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil
      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can
      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his
      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9
 
 
Q. Did God hear their prayers?
 
A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.
 
 
Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-
   ment?
 
A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has
   become very short.
 
      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3
 
      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye
      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for
      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8

The  foregoing  is a copy of the &#34;Does God Love You?&#34; tract printed by,
and available free of charge from, Family Radio.   A  number  of  minor
changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing
and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph
which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the
text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they
appear here as indented paragraphs.
 
 
I have read Mr. Camping&#39;s book, compared it with what the Bible actual-
ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what
the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that
there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed
one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these
matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,
it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our
eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more
senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with
respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a
copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself,

I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly
agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than
ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts
20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I
am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with
anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any
real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little
time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.  Feel free to

Topic 3:
game team year games season players play hockey win league
[more about the Messier-Samuelsson incident]
 I agree with Rick that Ulf&#39;s cross check wasn&#39;t illegal. It was the kind
 of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. Slo-mos
 sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are.
 Besides, if Messier can&#39;t take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen.

 Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn&#39;t been playing with the MoDo elite league
 team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years
 here before he can join the B&#39;s. I saw him play in the Swedish championship
 game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,
 but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to
 have a Ulf type-of-player on the B&#39;s team too? :)
 As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in
 division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,
 and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is
 considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is
 Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play
 in Elitserien next season, unless the B&#39;s can get him of course.
 I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
 watch in Swedish hockey this season.

 Staffan
------------------------

Not clear to me at all.  I&#39;d certainly rather have a team who was winning
4-1 games than 2-1 games.  In the 2-1 game, luck is going to play a much
bigger role than in the 4-1 game. 
------------------------
The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,
a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri
Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS
never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an
NHL record 9th OT loss this season.

Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill

Game Summary:

I didn&#39;t get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts
I didn&#39;t have the best radio coverage either. Here&#39;s the box score followed by
a few things I did pick up:

First Period:
	Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51
	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind&#39;Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)
Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,
Har (interference) 18:43

Second Period:
	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00
	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09
	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38
Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har
major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,
Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind&#39;Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50

Third Period:
	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)
	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11
	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind&#39;Amour, Roussel), 3:38
Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30

Overtime:
	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.
Penalties - None

Power Play:
	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4

Goalies:
	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)
	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)

On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off.

The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie.

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if
they get one shot and beat you fine. Don&#39;t give them another chance. Carkner,
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I&#39;ll bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play.

That&#39;s all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored, much less how.

From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I&#39;m surprised
that a former goalie wouldn&#39;t look closer at his defensive play), Tommy 
Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season
and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
But here&#39;s the odd part. He couldn&#39;t decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros, doesn&#39;t that make Lindros #2????

What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...

#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
The difference between the team&#39;s record with him and without him is no
accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the &#39;C&#39; on his jersey
next season.

#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,
and Tommy didn&#39;t have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn&#39;t
play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family
has a history of heart problems). There&#39;s no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.

#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can&#39;t argue with an all-time team high single season
scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn&#39;t have a single player
get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.
Not a tough choice.

Honorable mentions: Rod Brind&#39;Amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn&#39;t on the top line
this year and didn&#39;t get as much playing time. Then again, he didn&#39;t get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie
mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling
that with his shot he&#39;ll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he&#39;ll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come.

Garry Galley was the team&#39;s point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some
things you just can&#39;t argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
But consistency became a problem for him.

The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning
percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in
Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in
next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as
many goals as they allowed, 319.

The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them.

I hope you&#39;ve all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable.

That&#39;s all for now...

Detroit is a very disciplined team.  There&#39;s a lot of Europeans
in Detroit which would make the game fast, so Toronto would have
to slow the game down, which means drawing penalties, as a last
resort anyway.  Toronto will be a good team as soon as they get
more good players.  Toronto is just an average team, Detroit isn&#39;t
Ballard screwed Toronto when he was owner.  Everyone knows that.
and it&#39;s going to take time for Toronto to become a real force.
I expect Gilmour to be burnt out next year.  He can&#39;t pull the
whole team forever.

Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday
     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.
&#34;What could be better,&#34; declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs
are challenging?
     &#34;It&#39;s pitching, it&#39;s always been pitching that we&#39;ve lacked,&#34; announced
Ryne Sandberg.  &#34;If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or
Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we&#39;ll know we might be able to
win.
     &#34;Lord, I hope we pull it off.&#34;
     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete
Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut
the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw
to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.
     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to
third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this
year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a
gap in right-center.  &#34;Cool Papa&#34; Bell&#39;s speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone
grounded out to second, ending the threat.  
     &#34;Teams are starting to realize that you don&#39;t have to pitch to Schmidt or
Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on
Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells
Rose at first), and it&#39;s a credit to the Phillies that they&#39;ve been able to
sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.&#34;  So came the
analysis from Frank Chance.
     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas&#39; grounder
moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled
home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it
3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein
singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped
out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,
Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.
He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting
for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into
a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a
strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a
pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The
Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.
     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get
another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock
played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen
was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against
Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving
home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added
another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more
runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.
     Sunday&#39;s twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one
point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off
Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but
the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce
Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the
eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would
conclude their series with the Expos on Monday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st
     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.
The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren&#39;t among the
all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first
first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of
first in this wacky season.
     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2
Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.
The Cards captured Monday&#39;s game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve
Rogers 3-2.  &#34;We&#39;re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed,&#34; remarked Lou Brock.  &#34;I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t win this
division.&#34;
     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of
the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,
now 2 back - but in 4th!
    &#34;When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher&#39;s park like this,&#34; spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith
Hernandez added that &#34;their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,
and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.&#34;  The Pirates have made only
26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend
to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.
     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone
Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When
Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the
Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert
Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph
Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets&#39; Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie
Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on
first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent
Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing
Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the
Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve
allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right
field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered
to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep
center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park
homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,
and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.
------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): 
    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just wouldn&#39;t tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,
&#34;once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming
week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.&#34;
     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and
the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel
faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves&#39; park had been a homer
haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.
Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don
Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had
one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday&#39;s
doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the
National League record.  They were still a tad behind the &#39;61 Yankees&#39; pace.
They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after
retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but
faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.
     In the doubleheader, the Braves&#39; Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the
Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.
The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to
three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell
Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather
good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the
trade looked even better.  McGriff&#39;s batting average was even rising.  Of
course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the
outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.
     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two
home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray
Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel
Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was
scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after
10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working
his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and
Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,
and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the
Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly
emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):
     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in
the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  &#34;Normally,&#34; Drysdale remarked, &#34;I
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can&#39;t afford
to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can&#39;t
Davis will get decked once.&#34;
     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is
primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is
a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is
the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw
two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of
the nastness of the Astros&#39; park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all
around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The
foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,
with center field at 420 feet.  &#34;It&#39;s as if some three-year-old threw a
tantrum and told his playmates: &#39;If I can&#39;t hit home runs, nobody will hit
home runs&#39;,&#34; remarked Roy Campanella.
     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize
the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,
Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,
according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the
Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with
a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the
Astros didn&#39;t score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to
erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened
to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.
Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.
     &#34;I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,&#34; he explained.
     &#34;How can we do that,&#34; Pee Wee Reese wondered.
     &#34;They&#39;re going to be beating the ball down, so we&#39;ve got to be ready to
throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We&#39;ll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time.&#34;
     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The
Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan
Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando
Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers&#39;
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.
     &#34;We&#39;re mostly a power team,&#34; remarked Ron Cey.  &#34;Jackie and, when he
plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other
plays can do it now and then.  We&#39;re sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I
guess that&#39;s why they&#39;re so successful there.&#34;  Indeed, it seems that
basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The &#39;Stros
swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

Well, since the Oilers didn&#39;t win a heck of a lot of games, I&#39;m not sure
they deserve and MVP (&#34;can&#39;t win without him&#34;).  However, I&#39;d suggest Kelly
Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for
the All-Star game notwithstanding.

As for biggest surprise, I&#39;d say that Buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his &#34;breakthrough&#34; year (for him) last year, so he didn&#39;t
really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the
callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the
depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on
the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent
numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league
oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.
I think he&#39;ll be on the full-time roster next year.

As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers
dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or
even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn&#39;t far off.

- Notable team news (transactions and announcements)
 
 Note that this information is culled from press releases and posts.  It 
is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or 
of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two 
postings.
 
 Boston Bruins
  Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden 
finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project 
back on track to be finished in September 1995.
  Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following 
surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back.
**
  Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.

 Buffalo Sabres
1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)
  Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike 
Ramsey.
**
  Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the 
club&#39;s Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion 
Sabres in 1970, was the team&#39;s play-by-play announcer on both television 
and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season.
**
  Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of 
American Hockey League.

 Calgary Flames
  Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future 
considerations.
**
  Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt 
Lake City of International Hockey League.

 Chicago Blackhawks
        The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to 
open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA&#39;s Chicago Bulls and NHL&#39;s 
Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two 
teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the 
old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, 
located directly across the street, opens.
  Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report 
following a trade with Edmonton.

 Detroit Red Wings
  Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft 
pick.
  Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in 
the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft.
**
  Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall 
of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze 
plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site 
of the Michigan Hall of Fame.

 Edmonton Oilers
  Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug 
Weight.
  Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.
  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers&#39; lease with 
Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the 
city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to 
administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner 
Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has 
threatened to move the team if he doesn&#39;t get a better deal. He makes no 
money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat 
Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce 
significant revenues for other owners.
  Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the 
remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.

 Hartford Whalers
  Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.
  Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from 
Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick.
**
  The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center 
from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford 
Whalers franchise in the city.

 Los Angeles Kings
  Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark 
Hardy and Ottawa&#39;s fifth-round 1993 draft pick.

 Minnesota North Stars
1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S.
1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada
  The Dallas City Council has approved an agreement with the Minnesota 
North Stars that will bring the NHL club to Reunion Arena next season.
  Defenseman Mark Tinordi, captain of the North Stars, will be sidelined 
the rest of the season, including any postseason games the North Stars 
might play, because of a broken collarbone.
  Acquired defenseman Mark Osiecki from Winnipeg for ninth- and 10th-round 
draft picks in 1993.
  Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota.
  A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North 
Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Green&#39;s former executive 
assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described 
her outfits as &#34;very hot&#34; and &#34;very sexy,&#34; once slapped her hand as she 
was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it 
through a client&#39;s hair.
  The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season, 
announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for 
their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.
  The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it 
wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last 
home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must 
pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the team&#39;s late rent payment for 1992, 
which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take 
property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine.
**
  Derian Hatcher&#39;s game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL, 
allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars&#39; last two 
regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the 
end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league didn&#39;t 
rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars 
recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo, 
Mich., to replace Churla.

 Montreal Canadiens
  Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league 
defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.

 New Jersey Devils
**

  Manon Rheaume&#39;s first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta 
Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be 
a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the 
first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six 
goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After 
the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to 
compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East 
Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor 
league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
**
  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that 
the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the 
Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning 
general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that 
the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are 
exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But 
Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  &#34;We were disappointed 
with ESPN&#39;s irresponsible comment,&#34; Esposito said.  &#34;There is just no 
substance to the rumor.&#34; Rumors have been swirling for the past two years 
regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to 
build a new arena.

conference&#39;s other division (24) and two games against each of the 14 
Eastern Conference clubs (28).

- Draft news:

        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in 
June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one 
goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion 
drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction 
between forwards and defensemen.
        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down 
from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and 
Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.
        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of 
one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is 
that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.
        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises 
will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total 
of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa 
Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two 
new teams.
        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority 
drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst 
records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The 
expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, 
Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.
        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry 
Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new 
teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 
1994.

        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 
1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a 
delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.

        The site for the 75th Memorial Cup Tournament has yet to be 
chosen.  It will be staged in Ontario but the exact location won&#39;t be 
determined until next spring.
        In March of &#39;93, the two regular-season division champions from 
the Ontario Hockey League will meet in a best-of-seven series at the start 
of the playoff season.  The winner of the series earns the right to host 
the Memorial Cup, traditionally held in May.
        The eventual OHL champion will also participate in the tourney. 
But if the league champs also happen to be the club hosting the Memorial 
Cup, then the league finalists will advance as well.&#34;

  Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early 
November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local 
interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000 
salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players 
are not limited to three years in the league.
  A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93-
94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron 
confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under 
consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking 
games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are 
close to being confirmed as the league&#39;s newest members.

 - Major League Hockey
 
        A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States 
and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced 
Wednesday, February 10.
        Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of 
the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New 
Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.
        According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams 
playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have 
been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, 
Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto 
and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.
        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its 
rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world&#39;s finest hockey players.&#39;&#39;
        Boe said league play will have an international flair and 
discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the 
IIHF.
        ``We&#39;re removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and 
eliminating all tie games,&#39;&#39; said Boe.
        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.

 8. Answers to some frequently asked questions:
 
 Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?
 A: Most of the team during the 40-50&#39;s was made up of people who lived in 
and around Montreal. Hence they were called &#34;Les Habitants&#34; (natives of 
Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.
 
 Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?
 A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to 
signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer 
existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.

 Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?
 A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is 
a weekly journal with up-to-date info.
Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)
Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)
 
 Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in 
the NHL?
 A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 
chances.
 
 Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?
 A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when 
a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a 
+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-
handed goals do count for +/-.
 
 Q: What is the five-hole?
 A: The space between a goalie&#39;s pads. There are five major scoring zones: 
(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower 
right, and (5) five-hole.
 
 Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?
 A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950&#39;s when two best-of-seven 
series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a 
game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.

 Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?
 A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever 
to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for 
the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis 
Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat 
Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine 
shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately 
lost the game, 6-4.

 Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?
 A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed 
the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be 
worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 
million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.

 Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?
 A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National 
Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey 
League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as 
assistant general counsel. He became the league&#39;s chief legal officer in 
September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell 
University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.

 Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?
 A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and 
Colonial Hockey Leagues.

I&#39;ve never seen a game where one player has committed 5
penalties.  Something like this would require more attention by
the referee.


But you&#39;re creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
have been one before.  I can see the relationship between free
throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it&#39;s
obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more
opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that&#39;s
at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is
probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with.

Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA
game you attended was, that play was stopped too often.
Wouldn&#39;t your penalty shot rule take up more time during a
hockey game?
------------------------
For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush
the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in
the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched
seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How&#39;s this for numbers? Maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro&#39;s ERA is 0.75. The next lowest
on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!

It doesn&#39;t look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while
Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next
best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team&#39;s only HR, at
.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it&#39;s not hard to see why the team
is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn&#39;t sound bad when you&#39;re averaging three runs/game
and giving up 6.6/game. 

Still, it&#39;s early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should
come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, 
Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen
is a big question mark.

In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William
Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today&#39;s game
with California was cancelled.

True, coach Matikainen is ready to keep a spot for Teemu all the way
until the medal games. He wants Teppo Numminen, too. And Kurri, but for
them the spots cannot be left open for too long. Esa Tikkanen we have
already. 

Even without these players I think we have pretty good team. Young,
hungry, talented guys, no old players that have got everything (except
the gold). Yesterday&#39;s practise game, SWE-FIN 6-6, shows that the two
world&#39;s best hockey teams ;) are in prime shape.  The Finn line
Riihijarvi(slightly injured)-Saarikoski-Viitakoski shined. I bet these
two teams are the best in the NHL, too. Roger, Roger?

What do you people think about Team Canada with Lindros, Brind&#39;Amour,
Burke, Ranford, Recchi, Dineen...? Can they beat the Finns:?

Topic 6:
windows file files dos program version ftp ms directory running
In comp.os.ms-windows.misc you write:


you might want to look in windows FAQ for this one, but here is my best
explanation.  But I can&#39;t guarantee that I&#39;m not way off base...

The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking
directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must
use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).
Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that
points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your
disk to index to information in that file.

compressed disks are actually &#34;logical&#34; disks.  These disks have different
characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information
on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must
go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating
system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this &#34;inbetween&#34; program, windows
cannot use direct methods to read from the &#34;logical&#34; disk.

a permenant swap file is only there to &#34;reserve&#34; an area of the disk that
windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically
not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don&#39;t
know if it does or doesn&#39;t...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you
boot windows.)

a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows
via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded
the file access must go through DOS...TSR&#39;S (disk compression)...and BIOS in
order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)

more on permenent swap files...

i&#39;m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk
has seen the message &#34;you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested
size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan&#39;t to create this
swap file anyway&#34; or something like that.

well, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.
what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and
divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block
of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.

They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows
uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that&#39;s what he 
said!

I call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is
available to me if it&#39;s not going to use it?

any takers?

Well, in the latest Windows magazine, there is an advertisement for a program
that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk (Uninstaller)
but it can be used to update a network, but only for deleting, not adding
or changing their *.ini files.  (Uninstaller, by MicroHelp Inc.  $79
1-800-922-3383)

I am also looking for an *.ini updater for my PC network, and so far without
any luck.  So for the time being I have been pushing DOS and it&#39;s batch
language to its limit...look into DOS 5.0&#39;s (I am assumming that DOS 6.0
has the same command, maybe even more..or less..improved) REPLACE command.
I use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
file that is run everytime they invoke Windows.  This basically overwrites
their color schemes, but does what I need it to do.  Not neat, but does
the job...I&#39;m looking for a better solution though.

------------------------
This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two
new newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing
the one originally posted in January &#39;93 (and never taken to a vote).  The
proposed groups are described below:

NAME: 	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup
STATUS:  Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about
	 system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.

NAME:	 comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc
STATUS:	 Unmoderated.
PURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,
	 including issues such as security, networking features, console
	 mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.

RATIONALE:
	Microsoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family
	of operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish
	to argue about the meaning of an &#34;OS&#34;).  The family ranges from
	Modular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to
	Windows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over
	50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the
	actual release is slated for May/June &#39;93.

	While Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares
	an application programming interface with the other members of the
	Windows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-
	dows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking
	and security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for
	Windows 3.1.

	The user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows
	3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses
	Program Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-
	sents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced
	Windows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and
	NT also runs existing 3.1 applications.

	Thus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following
	groups with the other members of the Windows family:
		comp.os.ms-windows.apps
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc
		comp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32
	
	The following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as
	well as Windows 3.1:
		comp.os.ms-windows.announce
		comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy
	
	In conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the
	Windows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal
	structures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating
	systems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have
	undergone major rewrites without having been split into separate
	newsgroup hierarchies.

	Further, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --
	when the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-
	generation Windows, &#34;Chicago&#34;, debuts next year, surely it should
	remain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-
	tification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?


DISCUSSION PERIOD:
	The discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  

VOTING:
	The CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on
	the feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will
	be accepted prior to the CFV.

I quit windows normally to run a special DOS app, got done with it
and tried to start windows.  Ok got the title screen, Windows
background, DOS with an error about loading PROGMAN.EXE.  Hum, yep
PROGMAN.EXE is still there.  Must be bad, ok pull off PROGMAN.EXE
from a backup tape, start windows, get the windows title screen,
windows background, DOS with the same error.  HUM!  Fire up the
good ol&#39; Norton Disk Doctor, test, 500 lost clusters!  Ok, fix them,
and look through them, doesn&#39;t look important.  Remove the Windows
directory, and reinstall from disks.  Fire up windows, title screen,
background, Program Manager, Success!  

I have a 486/50 (Amy) with 4 meg of RAM, 120 meg HD, SVGA, running under
DOS 5.0, no special memory managers or stuff, just the basic Windows 3.1
A 12 meg permanent swap file using 32-bit Access.  I mainly use Windows
to run more that one DOS app at a time.  (ie downloading with Qmodem
with a DOS window open, and possibly POV running in the background.)  

I&#39;ve noticed that since I started using Windows a few months ago, lost
clusters have gotten more and more common.  Although I don&#39;t like
having data just disappear, it really haven&#39;t been a problem except
for today.  Has anyone else had any problems with lost clusters while
running windows?  And what could I do to fix the problem, I&#39;d sleep
better knowing Amy wasn&#39;t loosing her marbles. :)

------------------------
hi,
  Have you used Mac system 6.x or 7.x? If the answer is positive, you would
know if ms-windows is a &#34;mature&#34; OS.

  Days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real OS. I can see why
they have such question. Ms-windows confuses many people. Microsoft
simulated Mac, but it did a lousy job.  For example:

(1) You can not create hierarchy groups. There is no way to create a group
    in a group. (If you know how, please tell me.)
(2) Too many system parameters to take care of. 
(3) uncomplete documentation. It&#39;s not easy to find the reason why causes
    an unpredictable error.
(4) Group deleting/file deleting
    After deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.
    But if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full
    of nonsense files.
(5) share problem
    Once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some
    language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. You just
    can not open or save the program if it is loaded. It makes sense to
    prevent from saving, but not opening.

Microsoft try to compromise between DOS and windows, but they just make 
ms-windows a graphical DOS with capacity doing mutiple DOS jobs; 
the worst thing is they complicate the environment. The orginal purpose
of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make PC easier 
to use.
  
  It&#39;s by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if Microsoft want to
keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more
carefully before products distribute.

  No flame, please.
------------------------
Sorry, I did`nt tell exactly what I need.

Reposting and summarizing, for your information or additional comment.

*** THIS IS LONG ***

I have 16MB of memory on my 386SX (25 MHz), an Intel math coprocessor, and
a 120MB hard drive with 20MB free (no compression).  I have been running
Mathcad 3.1, under Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5MB RAM drive,
2MB/1MB Smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for
several months.

I am interested in the faster Mathcad 4.0, but I am concerned about reported
swap file requirements and the legitimacy of Mathsoft&#39;s claim about increased
speed.

TO 386SX USERS:

  Will Mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that I use a swap file?

So far, in response to a less detailed description of my setup, or in
unrelated postings, the more informed answers, on the net or by E-mail,
appear to be:

  1) by fuess@llnl.gov (David A. Fuess) &gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt; According to Mathsoft, no. Mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as
   &gt;&gt; not to overburden the physical resources. They say this is actually a
   &gt;&gt; win32s feature. A figure of 10MB was indicated to me as a minimum. But
   &gt;&gt; you might try anyway!

  2) by bert.tyler@satalink.com (Bert Tyler) &gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not all that certain that Mathcad is the culprit here.
   &gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt; I have a 486/66DX2 with 16MB of main memory (less 2MB for a RAMdisk and
   &gt;&gt; a bit for a DOS session that is opened as part of the startup process),
   &gt;&gt; which I have been running without any swapfile.  When I installed the
   &gt;&gt; WIN32s subsystem from the March Beta of the NT SDK, the WIN32s subsystem
   &gt;&gt; itself demanded the presence of a swapfile.  The only WIN32s program
   &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve run to date is the 32-bit version of Freecell that came with that
   &gt;&gt; subsystem.
   &gt;&gt;
   &gt;&gt; I gave Windows a small temporary swapfile (I&#39;m leery of files that must
   &gt;&gt; remain in fixed locations on my hard disk), and all seems well.

  3) by bca@ece.cmu.edu (Brian C. Anderson) &gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt; What is Win32?  I upgraded to Mathcad 4.0 and it installed a directory for
   &gt;&gt; Win32 under \windows\system .  During the upgrade it told me that win32
   &gt;&gt; was required.

  4) by case0030@student.tc.umn.edu (Steven V Case-1) &gt;&gt;

  &gt;&gt; MathCad 4.0 makes use of the Win32s libraries.  You&#39;ve probably
  &gt;&gt; heard about Win32s, it is a 32-bit Windows library that provides
  &gt;&gt; much of the Windows NT functionality (no support for threads and
  &gt;&gt; multitasking and such) but can be run under Windows 3.1.

  5) by rhynetc@zardoz.chem.appstate.edu (Thomas C. Rhyne) &gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt; I also have 16 Mb of ram, and indeed Mathcad 4.0 insisted on a permanent
   &gt;&gt; swapfile; it would not run otherwise.

  6) by bishop@baeyer.chem.fsu.edu (Greg Bishop) &gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt; 3) MathCAD absolutely requires 4MB RAM (with 12MB swap file) or 8MB RAM
   &gt;&gt; (with 8MB swap file).  It will give you a not enough memory error if the
   &gt;&gt; swap file is less than 8MB.  It is a MAJOR resource hog.  If you do not
   &gt;&gt; load the symbolic processor or the smart math, it takes about 5MB of RAM
   &gt;&gt; (real or virtual) just to load (again, due to the win32s libraries.

* So it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on Mathsoft&#39;s  *

********************************************************************************

I also received these answers:

  1) by mfdjh@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu (Dale Hample) &gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt; If you&#39;ve got 16 megs of RAM, why not configure 10megs as a ram disk for
   &gt;&gt; Mathcad?  DOS 6 permits different bootup configurations.

********************************************************************************

* Can Mathcad 4.0 + Win32 be configured to use such a RAM drive instead of a   *
* swap file?  If not, I don&#39;t see how using DOS 6.0 for an alternate bootup    *
* would provide Windows with this swap file.   Some time back I remember a     *
* discussion about the issues of using a RAM drive to support a swap file,     *

*                                                                              *

* By the way, is a full installation of DOS 6.0 required to avail oneself of   *
* the &#34;alternate bootup&#34; feature?  Which files from the installation disks are *

  2) by wild@access.digex.com (Wildstrom) &gt;&gt;

   &gt;&gt; Presumeably, you mean without a _permanent_ swap file. If Windows needs a
   &gt;&gt; swap file, it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn&#39;t exist.
   &gt;&gt; Permanent is generally faster though. I don&#39;t know why Mathcad wouldn&#39;t
   &gt;&gt; be happy with either type--Ver. 3.0 is and so should any program conforming
   &gt;&gt; to the Win specification.
------------------------
Perusing through my Windows 3.1 directory, I came across a file
called REGLOAD.EXE.  I assume this is part of the registration
database, but neither my Windows manual, Win Resource Kit, nor
PC Mag&#39;s description of files in the Windows directory had a
reference to it.  At least not one that I could find.  Does
REGEDIT.EXE use it?  Or am I way off base?

Topic 8:
key chip clipper encryption keys escrow government public algorithm nsa


I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m as willing to speculate as anyone.

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.
Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other
algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on
a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something
like DES) for the encryption.

How could the &#34;back door&#34; keys work in this system?  I can see a few
possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that
the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door
keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers
used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.

Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips
simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip&#39;s own
internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys
usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip&#39;s
secret key doesn&#39;t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be
identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most
straightforward to me.)

Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the
message itself has a &#34;dual key&#34; property, that possession of either of
two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from
the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.

It&#39;s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised
during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and
December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would
participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn&#39;t quite fit into
what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early
knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with
Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.
------------------------
Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors
and provides some additional information and explanation.


                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY

                               Dorothy Denning

                           Revised, April 21, 1993


INTRODUCTION

On April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring
together the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program
to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of
law enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption
chip called the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; together with a split-key approach to
escrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from
both are needed to reconstruct a key.


CHIP CONTENTS

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called &#34;Skipjack.&#34;  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

The chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the
&#34;MYK-78.&#34;  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.


ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&amp;T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

The ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver&#39;s device using the
session key:

   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .


CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW

All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented
Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips
are programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at
Mykotronx.

At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random
80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.
  
To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
64-bit block R1:

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
agencies.

As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are
written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a
file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part
U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third
disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent
2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing
an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not
know the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit
key parts.  

The third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are
programmed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents
leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no
information is left behind.
 
The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the
room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,
and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to
the escrow agencies. 

The escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not
be the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or
both may be independent from the government.


LAW ENFORCEMENT USE

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the
Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the
family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap
has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is
then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who
return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed
together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the
session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will
be accomplished through a special black box decoder.


CAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION

A successor to the Clipper Chip, called &#34;Capstone&#34; by the government
and &#34;MYK-80&#34; by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include
the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast
exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for
testing on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for
delivery in June or July.

------------------------
The following document summarizes the Clipper Chip, how it is used,
how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the
escrow process, and how law enforcement decrypts communications.
Since there has been some speculation on this news group about my
own involvement in this project, I&#39;d like to add that I was not in
any way involved.  I found out about it when the FBI briefed me on
Thursday evening, April 15.  Since then I have spent considerable
time talking with the NSA and FBI to learn more about this, and I
attended the NIST briefing at the Department of Commerce on April 16.  
The document below is the result of that effort.

When law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they
will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get
access to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in
place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with
Clipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the
family key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a
warrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow
agents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce
the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.
Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished
through a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.

------------------------
Hmm, followup on my own posting... Well, who cares.

First let me try to work out the facts that we get to know about the
Clipper-Chip, from what Hellman and Denning were able to tell us:

The chip itself is not confined to (digital) telephony, but performs
general encryption in a symmetric manner.  The chip supports CFB OFB
ECB (and whatever the fourth mode of operation for DES is), the algorithm
consists of 32 rounds of *whatever*, and takes 80-Bit keys. Input data
seems to be 64 Bit? Yes.
So if two people want secure communication (whatever that means when 
Clipper is involved) they have first to agree on ONE secret key. 
(Or is it one key per direction ?)
They can exchange this key via DH-schemes or however.
Somehow the two feed their so won secret key into the Clipper-chip
which is now ready to work.
The clipper chip carries an unique Serial-Number (30 Bit&#39;s), and 160 Key-Bits.
These 160 key-bits seem to have been gained by encrypting the serial-number
with 160 seed-bits. (The seed-bits seem not to be stored in the chip)
At beginning of communication (and perhaps at certain invtervals whithin??)
before sending the fist real 64-bit output of the first encryption the Clipper
chip put&#39;s out packets (I guess 3) which represent the serial number,
and the session key. This might look like
X{ E[K; chipkeyK1+K2], serial number}
where X is a transformation of these 3? Packets involving a family-key.
This family(sp?)-key is equal for ALL chips. (X might be a simple XOR ???)
After that, the (digital?) phone-call can be done as usual, every packet
being encrypted and decrypted by Clipper.

Denning describes how K1 and K2 shall be generated, using a seed of 160
Bit&#39;s.

Now, leaving alone politics, which does not concern me as much as you, not
being an American Citicien(tm) [ :-) ] , there are some weak points in this
scheme, which might be exploited by several parties.

As far as I know about the generation of K1,K2 ; S1 and S2 look like the 
obvious backdoor. They could be used to generate the chip-keys by knowing
the serial-number (and also the family-key) of the chip. I really can&#39;t
imagine why these seeds would be needed otherwise, as true random-sources
for the generation of the K1,K2 can be bought for not to much money.

Then, the escrows. Each of them will get 80 bit of a 160-Bit key. Security
could (as little as existant) be maximized by giving them 160-bits
each, which have to be xored together to give the K1,K2. Now let&#39;s simply
assume the escrows are trustworthy, and can&#39;t be fooled by criminals or
law enforchemnt agencies. (And there will be no quarrel between escrows
and l.e.a which would hinder the l.e.a in doing their duties, and so on
and so on) Once the keys are surrendered, the corresponding
chip is compromised forever. Not very clever, IMHO [ :-)) ].
How about sending in the encrypted session-keys for each phone-call that
the police (or whoever) want&#39;s to listen to? Escrows could then simply decode
this session-key and send it back to police. (And would naturally not do this
after the warrant has expired...) This would be a better technical solution,
but I guess politics will not work that way.

Apparently (as Miss Dennings stated) the only one performing actually decodes
of intercepted messages shall be the FBI. Great. So local guys can not inter-
cept (understand) your traffic anymore. Does this mean that the FBI monopolizes
the right to do legal wiretaps ? (How is law over there, I have no idea who
is allowed to tap, and who not) This certainly means that watched communi-
cations will be routed automatically from the service-providing company
to the FBI, if the communicaiton is a watched one. And this means as far
as I understand it that the family-key has to be known by each switching-
company, and those providing cellular-phone servies etcetc. So the family-key
will not be very secret, and thus serial-numbers of calls will be readable
by anybody who cares. I _like_ traffic-analysis!

What do you guess, what happens, if you use the chip in ECB mode, and the
first few packets of the chip are somehow lost or garbled? So the session
key would not be actually broadcasted over the line? Hmmm. Shouldn&#39;t be so
difficult to do *that* :^)

And now a last point, for the other side. After all I have read and heard about
Clipper (not the programming language for dBase, is it ? [:-)]) it seems
to have many advantages, which shold not be overseen!


Now an afterthought to your rights. Please note that I have no idea what I am
talking about!!!

I am not very sure in what position your government actually is *legally*

but not under what conditions. Hmm, tricky situation :-(

------------------------
 
   Not necessarily.  I&#39;ve been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme
is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,
either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme
like Diffie-Hellman.  If there&#39;s an out-of-band transmission of a shared
session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone
company or some other online central authority generates a session key and
sends it to both users, then what&#39;s the point of going to the trouble of
having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for
a copy of the session key for each call.
 
   Now, it&#39;s probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of
every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will
be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-
signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,
stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to
everyone&#39;s public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the
security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don&#39;t use your
designated key, you can&#39;t get a verified connection to other standard chips.
 
   It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to
use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair
and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call
most people and establish secure communications....
------------------------


The description of the chip&#39;s operation evidently leaves out some of the
key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding
to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the
result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either
way there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  It isn&#39;t
clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must
be provided by other system components.
------------------------
Here are some corrections and additions to Hellman&#39;s note, courtesy of
Dorothy Denning.  Again, this is reposted with permission.

Two requests -- first, note the roles of S1 and S2.  It appears to me
and others that anyone who knows those values can construct the unit
key.  And the nature of the generation process for K1 and K2 is such
that neither can be produced alone.  Thus, the scheme cannot be
implemented such that one repository generates the first half-key, and
another generates the second.  *That* is ominous.

Second -- these postings are not revealed scripture, nor are they
carefully-crafted spook postings.  Don&#39;t attempt to draw out hidden
meanings (as opposed to, say, the official announcements of Clipper).
Leave Denning out of this; given Hellman&#39;s record of opposition to DES,
which goes back before some folks on this newsgroup knew how to read, I
don&#39;t think you can impugn his integrity.

Oh yeah -- the folks who invented Clipper aren&#39;t stupid.  If you think
something doesn&#39;t make sense, it&#39;s almost certainly because you don&#39;t
understand their goals.

Subject: Re:  Clipper Chip
To: (a long list of folks)

I was also briefed by the NSA and FBI, so let me add a few comments to
Marty&#39;s message:

        The Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in 

The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks (like DES) and the chip supports
all 4 DES modes of operation.  The algorithm uses 32 rounds of scrambling
compared with 16 in DES.

	In addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his 
	or her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key 
	plain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be 

K is the session key shared by the sender and receiver.  Any method
(e.g., public key) can be used to establish the session key.  In the
AT&amp;T telephone security devices, which will have the new chip, the key
is negotiated using a public-key protocol.
 
	encrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, 
	and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part 
	message which will then be encrypted under the system key SK 
	producing

	     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}

My understanding is that E[M; K] is not encrypted under SK (called the
&#34;family key&#34;) and that the decrypt key corresponding to SK is held by
law enforcement.  Does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?  I
will also check it out, but this is 7am Sunday so I did not want to wait.

        The unit key 
	will be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 
	and K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow 

The unit key, also called the &#34;chip key,&#34; is generated from the
serial number N as follows.  Let N1, N2, and N3 be 64 bit blocks
derived from N, and let S1 and S2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.
Compute the 64-bit block 

        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] 

(Note that this is like using the DES in triple encryption mode with
two keys.)  Similarly compute blocks R2 and R3 starting with N2 and N3.
(I&#39;m unlear about whether the keys S1 and S2 change.  The fact that
they&#39;re called seeds suggests they might.)  Then R1, R2, and R3 are
concatenated together giving 192 bits.  The first 80 bits  form K1 and
the next 80 bits form K2.  The remaining bits are discarded.

	decided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that 
	they will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they 
	must be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. 

Marty is right on this and the FBI has asked me for suggestions.
Please pass them to me along with your reasons.  In addition to Marty&#39;s
criteria, I would add that the agencies must have an established record
of being able to safeguard highly sensitive information.  Some suggestions
I&#39;ve received so far include SRI, Rand, Mitre, the national labs (Sandia,
LANL, Los Alamos), Treasury, GAO.

	When a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law 
	enforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information 
	flowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that 
	they may do this constantly on all links, with or without a 
	court order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links 
	over which a message will flow.] 

My understanding is that there will be only one decode box and that it
will be operated by the FBI.  The service provider will isolate the
communications stream and pass it to the FBI where it will pass through
the decode box, which will have been keyed with K.

	the details so he could review the cases as required by
	law, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned
	over 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not
        comply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: 
        No single person or authority should have the power to
        authorize wiretaps

No single person does, at least for FBI taps.  After completing a mound
of paperwork, an agent must get the approval of several people on a chain
that includes FBI legal counsel before the request is even taken to the
Attorney General for final approval.

I have an idea as to why the encryption algorithm needs to be keep secret,
and some things that i think it implies. (Of course these could all be

from 

                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY
                               Dorothy Denning
                           Revised, April 21, 1993

.
.
.

The Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block
encryption algorithm called &#34;Skipjack.&#34;  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys
(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling
(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of
operation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic
Codebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.

Each chip includes the following components:

   the Skipjack encryption algorithm
   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips
   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip

.
.
.

ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP

To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&amp;T
telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and
we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure
conversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K
with the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place
without the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can
be used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.

Once the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The
telephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two
values:

   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , 

which are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement
field thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U
concatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family
key F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

------------------

suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but
did not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from
if law enforcement field 
   E[E[K; U] + N; F]
not knowing N would might make this much harder.

Now suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),
If I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U
for a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the
other party.

If I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could
make my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also
allows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are
saying but I could know who you are saying it too.

Now I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of
messages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key
generation method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that
matter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U&#39;s will be
chosen from know weak keys for the system.

Obviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement
for whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that
it is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of
people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some &#34;panel of experts&#34; is
going to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget
grinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.

So, am I wrong? Or are these problems.
------------------------

One more time...

    If they released the algorithm, it would be possible for someone
    to come up with an implementation which was identical, but
    lacking an escrowed key.

    Note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was
    being kept secret for security of the key escrow system.  In this
    case security means &#34;an escrowed key for EVERY clipper chip&#34;.


    Assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of
    the algorithm, and the escrow system, which would you buy :

     (a)  Chip from firm A with the escrowed key
     (b)  Second source chip from reputable firm B with no key
          in government escrow.
------------------------

Oh? Hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.&#39;&#39;
That&#39;s the key which I called K_P, the session key. According to
Hellman, if Alice and Bob are communicating with the Clipper Chip,
then Alice chooses ``her own key&#39;&#39; and Bob chooses ``his own key.&#39;&#39;
This is incompatible with the suggestion that when Alice and Bob are
talking, they use a _common_ K_P, chosen by classical or public-key
approaches.

The protocol/key-management description published so far is either
incomplete or incorrect. It leaves me with no idea of how the system
would actually _work_. I hope the CPSR FOIA request succeeds so that
we get full details.

Topic 9:
drive scsi drives hard disk ide floppy controller cd mac
I have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 Mg Seagate IDE drive and a controler  
built into the motherboard. I want to add a SCSI drive (a quantum prodrive  
425F 425 MG formatted). I have no documentation at all and I need your  
help!

As I understand it, here is the process of adding such a drive.  Could you  
please tell me if I&#39;m right..

1- Buy a SCSI contoler.  Which one? I know Adaptec is good, but they are  
kind of expensive.  Are there any good boards in the $100 region? I want  
it to be compatible with OS2 and Unix if possible.  Also, I have seen on  
the net that there are SCSI and SCSI2 drives. Is this true? Does the  
adapter need to be the same as the drive? What type of drive is the  
quantum?

2- connect the drive to the adapter via a SCSI cable and the power cable.
Do i have to worry about the power supply? I think I have 200 watts and  
all I&#39;m powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.

3- Setup the BIOS to recognize the drive as the second drive.  What type  
of drive is this? I don&#39;t have the numbers for this drive.

4- Format and create partitions on the drive. Do I use format or fdisk? I  
think that IDE drives can&#39;t be low-level formatted. Is it the same with  
SCSI? How exactly does fdisk work? I have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual  
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk.  Ideally, I would want  
the drive partitioned in to two partitions D: and E: how do I do this?

Well that seems to be all. Is there anythiing I&#39;m forgetting? 
Any help is *really* appreciated, I&#39;m lost...

Hi!

I have a problem with my floppy drives. In an effort to make my 3.5&#34; drive 
(normally b:) my a: drive, I switched the order of connections on the cable 
from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. I booted up, changed the CMOS
settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
The drive lights didn&#39;t come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
those drives.

I switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
restored the original CMOS settings. The lights for the floppies came on
during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
I see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
to be no disk access. MSD.EXE and Norton SI detect both drives, but when I 
try to get detailed information about a: or b:, Norton SI tells me that there
is no disk in the drive.

Can anyone offer any suggestions?
I&#39;m in desperate need of help!!!

Thank you for your time.

There is a simple answer.  If my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive.  Any &#34;built-in&#34; drives e.g. IDE are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive.  But if there are already two drives, then no can do.

The solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  It works like a champ!  I
have seen a similar situation before.

Howdy,

Sorry if this has been covered before:

One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his
NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said &#34;No problem&#34; and went to work.
Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during 
installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit 
Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted 
with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition 
was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn&#39;t think you could go over a
32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried 
to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn&#39;t allow me to do.  I am 
unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I 
kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS 
installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for 
&#34;Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC&#34;)...

Thanks in advance,

Hi,
I&#39;ve got a Multi I/O card (IDE controller + serial/parallel
interface) and two floppy drives (5 1/4, 3 1/2) and a
Quantum ProDrive 80AT connected to it.
I was able to format the hard disk, but I could not boot from
it. I can boot from drive A: (which disk drive does not matter)
but if I remove the disk from drive A and press the reset switch,
the LED of drive A: continues to glow, and the hard disk is
not accessed at all.
I guess this must be a problem of either the Multi I/o card
or floppy disk drive settings (jumper configuration?)
Does someone have any hint what could be the reason for it.
Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM
Thanks,
Thomas

`My Western Digital also has three sets of pins on the back. I am using it with
`another hard drive as well and the settings for the jumpers were written right 
`on the circuit board of the WD drive......MA SL ??

Well, I figured out how the jumpers go.  Now I have quite a different
problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn&#39;t know.  I have both drives
working, the C: system formatted and all of my hardware installed.  Only
problem is, that during the boot up sequence, the computer does not want
to pass up looking for a system on the A: drive.

Reinitialization all goes fine and the BIOS seems to be configured to
what is necessary.  All the drive tests work, but when the thing comes
back around to the a: drive and there is no disk present, it just spins.
If you insert a disk into drive a with a system however, it works fine
and boots up (ie how installed all my software)

Any additional help on this will be most welcome....

------------------------
I have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in a 
NuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit color 
is possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scan
rate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it
can go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
software control panel.

  This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDraw 
calls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeing
up the mac processor for other tasks. 

  The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last night
was $1738 at Mac&#39;s Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is just
over a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and the
original manuals.

I have heard many things about the ATI Ultra Pro card. Some have
been positive but most are negative. Could people please confirm
these?  (I am interested in the EISA version in particular).

1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.

2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches
   set but it is much slower.

3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.

4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many
   cases.

5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.

6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)

Thanks for your feedback. I will summarize.

------------------------
I&#39;ve got a 386 20Hz computer which is under warranty and my Trident
8900C video card is starting to play-up (surprise, surprise). Therefore
I&#39;m going to try to exchange it for a better card.

The BIG Question is:

Which video card is high quality and with an
acceptable price tag (on student budget) ???
------------------------
Here&#39;s a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumped
myself and a few others:

What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?

EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don&#39;t
rob my SIMM&#39;s), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?). 
Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on the
cache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the SIMM&#39;s?  Or does it still speed things up by
providing a &#39;secondary staging&#39; area for data normally passed directly into
the SIMM RAM cache?

I&#39;m confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, Daystar
FastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on some
operations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMM
accesses?

Please help, I&#39;m trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIci
system described in the EX above.
------------------------



Windows: The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards are
	 significantly faster doing Windows than the ATI card.

VGA:	 The recent reviews have all shown that the P9000 cards they looked
	 at are significantly slower doing VGA than the ATI card.  About
	 1/2 the speed, as I recall.

	 The big question for me is the Orchid V9000 card.  Each of the 
	 P9000 cards tested so far has had the W5186 to do VGA.  Orchid
	 is the only one I know about (I don&#39;t know about AMI) that uses
	 the W5286 for VGA.  That is reportedly faster.
	 
	 I would like to know whether the Orchid card can do VGA as fast as
	 the ATI card.  If so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.
	 (Advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)

Someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
Orchid V9000 card -- has that card arrived?  What do the benchmarks look
like?

Also, is the AMI P9000-based card real?  What does it use for VGA?  Speed?
------------------------
I have the local bus card also, and don&#39;t have any such problems with it
now, but this is the second card I&#39;ve gotten - the first card didn&#39;t work
in VGA mode correctly.  Maybe they still have some quality control problems.
I would suggest checking with ATI (I went through the vendor I bought the
card from since the problem showed up immediately).  I never was able to
get through to ATI&#39;s technical support number.  

I sure like the way the card performs though.  I have the 2MB ATI ultra
pro - local bus, and it is fast even in 1024x768x16bpp mode.

I recently bought an apparantly complete Expansion Chassis by Mountain
Computer Inc.  It consists of a box with 8 Apple ][+ compatible slots,
powersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer
to be expanded.  There was also included a small card with empty sockets on top
and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard
somewhere after pulling a chip.  There&#39;s an empty socket also on the interface
card and a short 16-pin DIP jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.
 
This technological marvel came with no docs and I haven&#39;t a clue as how to hook
this thing up.  If anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this I
could really use copies of them or at least some help.
 
I need to know:
 
o How to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis.
o How to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card
  and if the small card is used.
o The purposes of the various jumper-pins on the card (it has more
  of those than my CMS SCSI card!)

syncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor like
my home Viewsonic 6.  I like the Multisyncs because it&#39;s easy to run them

I&#39;m not 100% sure, but I think the T800 was a 25MHz transputer?  so ya tie
a gazillion of them together to get 100mips.  (The newest is the T9000
which kicks anyone&#39;s butt :)... haven&#39;t seen them used much though).

Anyway, to respond, I think the Pentium (CISC) is better than the more advanced
RISC (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66MHz Pentium has approximately the
same &#34;performance&#34; as the superduper 133MHz Alpha - here, performance is the
weird Specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what I *heard* - the
Alpha still kicks in the P5&#39;s butt in fp - again, this is what I *heard*).
and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and
make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though
you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).

If you can make a &#34;CISC&#34; chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)
with the ideas behind the &#34;RISC&#34; ideology, you got a CISC chip.  And then
I admit I can&#39;t see the advantages of RISC over CISC...

If the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively
speaking).

Now I may sound like I like intel, but I&#39;ll have to say that the P5 is some
real kick butt pile of Si and SiO2...

But I hope that Motorola really catches up with the 68K line... or I&#39;m gonna
start crying...

   Just what do gay people do that straight people don&#39;t?

Absolutely nothing.

I don&#39;t care what gay people do among each other, as long as they don&#39;t make

Not in a &#39;pansy&#39; way of gay (I know a few), but just &#39;one of the guys&#39;.
He doesn&#39;t push anything on me, and we give him the same respect back, due
to his position.

Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry, let me first say that I&#39;ve been sort of
a Cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly,
but he&#39;s more-or-less harmless.  On Saturday, however, he crossed the lines of
good taste:


This is the best he can do?!!  Gee Don, tremendous amounts of professionalism
here.  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with
this nonsense...making fun of names??  It&#39;s bad enough that he makes asinine
blanket statements about European players, but he&#39;s now resorted to making fun
of their names too?  He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week
when he said that Teemu would never make it to his &#39;Rock &#39;em, Sock &#39;em&#39; video
until he dropped the gloves...


Well, what he _said_ was that even though he&#39;s been around the league for quite
some time, he still doesn&#39;t know who&#39;s where w.r.t. conference and division
names.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades
or so....he also invited the audience to &#34;Name the teams in the Wales...quick,
quick!&#34; Followed by &#34;Ah, you don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t know....&#34;  

Sorry Don.  Wrong on this one.


This was absolutely hilarious.

Don&#39;s argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly
good...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in
the NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he&#39;s never been one for objectivity,
has he?

If you don&#39;t already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/
finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the
current payoff cost.

If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the
payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.  (If this
turns out to be a negative number, you need to reconsider the deal.)
Subtract this difference from the price of the new car.  This is the
size of the loan you will need for the new car.

The dealer will take care of paying off the loan on your old car out
of the money you give them when you pick up your new car.

At least that&#39;s how it worked for me 5 years ago in Ohio...

Hi, maybe someone can help me here...
I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now.
The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it.
A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi).
The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification
he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced
to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before
selling the car to me.)

Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don&#39;t know
what this could mean...
Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?
Or is this an indication that the car was abused?
Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?
The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,
I don&#39;t know how to verify this...  I&#39;ve seen the paint chipped away
in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.

Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and
well kept, it&#39;s currently out of warranty
(a similarly priced &#39;90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km
worth of warranty left) and I don&#39;t want to worry about paying for
any repair bills...
But, I also need a car for 5 people...  

When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?

I would very much appreciate your input in this.
Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.
Thanks!

While I don&#39;t read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar
information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..

I bought a &#39;93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)
after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, 
and Celica.

Check this month&#39;s Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  

My criteria: a &#34;fun&#34; car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.
I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.
The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don&#39;t have an air bag.
Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).
The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.
The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  
I didn&#39;t like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.
The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.
The Celica was &#34;ok&#34; but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat
overpriced too) in non-turbo form.
I never considered the 240SX since it didn&#39;t have an airbag.  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but that&#39;s it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.
Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)

The car design is different than earlier years, so it&#39;s too early to see its
reliability so far.  For what it&#39;s worth, my comments:

My dislikes:
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.
Headlights have &#34;stuck&#34; up a few times (weather?)
air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn&#39;t drain completely.
crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn&#39;t like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).
assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not 
stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.
Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C&#39;mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I&#39;m waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner.
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 

My Likes:
engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1
handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)
transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)
Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the &#39;90 SHO I drive)
stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)
low cowl (good visibility in front)
Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)
ABS/Air bag (see above)
rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)
No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

As you can see, I&#39;m primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn&#39;t
have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling
point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  

The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn&#39;t changed
much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the
Probe&#39;s suspension doesn&#39;t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.
If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They&#39;ll find
that they have no room in the back and you&#39;ll find that the car rides
differently (if that&#39;s &#34;better&#34; is up to you).  Also, there&#39;s a lot of glass
around you which I wasn&#39;t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about
the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat.  I&#39;ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
Leather and the keyless entry system weren&#39;t available when I got the car so
I can&#39;t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  

I wouldn&#39;t want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren&#39;t meant for snow, and the seats assume
that you&#39;re not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles (and I was really trying).  
There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they&#39;re rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CD&#39;s max.  The center console/storage bin/arm
rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth &#34;pouch&#34;
but that&#39;s it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.
And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!

Lastly, don&#39;t store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

Safety is an important criterium for me when buying a car. I won&#39;t buy a 
small car like a Civic or whatever.

Great = Safety + Handling + Speed  -  for me

Seems to me that you would be more &#34;dead&#34; in a small car than a large car 
after an accident.
------------------------
   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New
Car Guide.  What I found was a car would be given a &#39;Recommended&#39;
under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a
driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed
in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small
car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small
cars listed.  There were many such cases of &#39;great&#39; vehicles
where you wouldn&#39;t survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is

seen nor heard of a vandal opening one.  I imagine that there
would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have 
to crawl furthur under the car to open it.  

Car vandals are usually real traditional in their methods, and do things
that don&#39;t get them dirty, like keying your car, dumping sand, sugar
or mothballs in the gas tank, TPing it, etc.

I&#39;m wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? I&#39;ve been
doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I&#39;ve got
over 150k. I&#39;ve heard people talk about how doing this can damage a
transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?

On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so
worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.
To date I&#39;ve driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords &amp; a chevy. Some where
harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother
quicker &amp; easier they where to shift.

My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window,
I lightly press the accelerator &amp; try agian. I&#39;ve found that clutchless
shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some
times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5.

&#34;Van&#39;dan sonra ilk isyan Sebinkarahisar&#39;da basladi. 1915 senesi 5 
 haziran da, Sivasli Murat [Hamparsum Boyaciyan - sa] denilen bir 
 caninin emri altinda 500 kadar cete Sebinkarahisari basti. Burasi o 
 zaman en onemli askeri bir yerdi. Erzurum bolgesinde Rus ordusu ile 
 savasan Osmanli Ordularinin butun ikmal araclari buradan gecmekte idi. 
 Ermeniler boyle onemli bir yer isgal ettikleri takdirde Turk 
 ordularinin ikmali yapilamayacak ve Rus Ordularinin harekati 
 kolaylasacakti. Sebinkarahisarin islam mahalleleri tamamen atese 
 verildi. Her rastlanan Turk iskence ile olduruldu.

 Mus&#39;da ayni sekilde isyan devam ediyordu. Sason daglari Ermeni 
 eskiyalariyla dolu idi. Bu isyanlari, ordunun arkasini vurmak ve Rus 
 Ordusunun ilerlemesini saglamak icin Ermenilerin pasa dedikleri Rupen 
 idare ediyordu. Bundan baska, Rus Ordularinin Rus - Turk sinirindan 
 gecerek Turk topraklarina girdikleri bu safhada Rus Ordusu icinde 
 bulunan Ermeni gonullu alaylariyla Rus Ordularinin isgali altina giren 
 Ermeni koylerindeki silahli halk, Turk koylerine hucum ederek bu 
 koyleri yakip yikmislar ve Turk halkini hatira gelmeyen mezalim ve 
 iskence ile oldurmulerdir. 

p. 285.

&#34;Bu suretle sehirde 23 gun cok kanli olaylar cereyan etti, bu sure 
 sonunda Van, Ermeniler tarafindan tamamen isgal olundu. Buradan 
 kacabilen Turklerin, Ermenilerin davranislari hakkinda verdikleri 
 haberler tuyler urpertici idi. Cunku isyancilar halkin cogunu oldurmus,
 kadinlarin irzina gecmis, Turk kadin ve kizlarini bazi evlerde 
 topladiktan sonra buralarini Genelev haline getirmislerdir. O zaman 
 Van&#39;da 1500 kadar kadin ve cocuktan baska Turk kalmamis, bunlari da 
 oradaki Amerikalilar korumustur. Sehir bastan basa harab olmus, carsi 
 kamilen yanmisti.&#34;

Hey folks--

I&#39;ve got a pair of Dunlop sportmax radials of my ZX-10, and they&#39;ve been
very sticky (ie no slides yet), but all this talk about the Metzelers has
me wondering if my next set should be a Lazer comp K and a radial Metzeler
rear...for hard sport-touring, how do the choices stack up?

Likewise for me please. First time I&#39;ve hear of it, but I&#39;ve beem looking

I&#39;m not up on the details of US patent law, but I think this is incorrect.
There is a &#34;reasonable use&#34; exemption for *copyright*.  There is none for
*patents*.  The exemptions from patent licensing are quite narrow; R&amp;D work
is exempt but personal use is not.  That is, it&#39;s okay to experiment with
a patented idea, but not to put it to practical use (e.g. to improve your
stereo), even if it&#39;s only your own private practical use.

Of course, it is unlikely that discreet personal use will ever be detected
or that you will ever be sued over it.

____________________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                                  April 5, 1993 

                       REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT
        EN ROUTE TO CAMDEN YARDS FOR ORIOLES OPENING DAY GAME
	     
                              MARC Train
                       En Route to Camden Yards



11:45 A.M. EDT
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, what do you think of Jesse Jackson&#39;s 
protest today?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it&#39;s an informational protest.  
I think it&#39;s fine.  The owners put out a statement few days ago, 
which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase 
minority ownership and minority increases in management.  I think we 
should.  I&#39;m encouraged by Don Baylor&#39;s appointment out in Colorado.  
And I think it&#39;s time to make a move on that front.  So, I think it&#39;s 
a legitimate issue, and I think it&#39;s -- like I said, it&#39;s an 
informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to 
the game.  So, I think it&#39;s good.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think they&#39;re moving fast enough?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that it was a good first 
step.  And I think you&#39;ll see some movement now.  And I think it&#39;s an 
issue that deserves some attention, and they&#39;re obviously going to 
give it some.  And I think that Reverend Jackson being out there will 
highlight the issue.  So I think it&#39;s fine.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, how about the logjam in the Senate 
on the economic stimulus plan?  Do you think they&#39;ll be able to break 
that and get cloture?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don&#39;t know, we&#39;re working at it.  I 
mean, it&#39;s a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one 
of the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you 
know, this is a -- it&#39;s just a political power play.  In the Senate 
the majority does not rule.  It&#39;s not like the country.  It&#39;s not 
like the -- it&#39;s not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they 
can stop majority rule.  And that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.  There are a 
lot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote 
for the stimulus program but there&#39;s enormous partisan political 
pressure not to do it.  
	     
	     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when 
no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an 
economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they&#39;re 
willing to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston 
and Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.  It&#39;s very 
sad.  I mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in 
a hurry based on local priorities, and it&#39;s one that the Republicans 
had always championed.  Just about the only Democrat champions of the 
program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots 
level, governors and senators.  I just think it&#39;s real sad that they 
have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep 
Americans out of work.  I think it&#39;s a mistake.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

  Yup. I agree with ya. I think Devils can beat Red Wings easily. SO I think
  all those who send in their votes should try all these diffrent teams

  Oh....I see...I didn&#39;t realize this...

  I think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic, and your
  reasons for thinking the way you do. You should then distribute them
  amongst the world&#39;s population. You see, I don&#39;t think there are many
  people who are aware of this fact. Thank you for telling us the truth.

  BTW: I would start by sending your flyers to each of the UN officials.
	   Also, after you have distributed your flyers you might consider
       hiding. You see, I think that once more people read what you think
       they will have to lock you up in a mental institute; and don&#39;t think
       they will ever let you out.
 
  It is a strange strange world you live in. I feel sorry for you.

By the way, what do people think about the Opel CAlibra?

Oh?


What is wrong with *this* motto, now?  If you wouldn&#39;t approve of
even that one, I am beginning to think that you just have something
against mottos in general.  What do you think of &#34;E plurbis unum?&#34;
------------------------


I think that domestication will change behavior to a large degree.
Domesticated animals exhibit behaviors not found in the wild.  I
don&#39;t think that they can be viewed as good representatives of the
wild animal kingdom, since they have been bred for thousands of years
to produce certain behaviors, etc.

Killed by handgun, or killed?  If I&#39;m dead, I don&#39;t much care if it
was by being shot or stabbed to death.





I don&#39;t think you can get an accurate indicator of how safe England is
compared to Switzerland by concentrating only on handgun murders and  
completely ignoring murders by other weapons, not to mention the rate of
other violent crimes.  If there are more guns in circulation, if follows
that more people will be killed with them &#39;cause they are available to
the person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they
have to do it with a gun, knife, or bare hands.  

The gun control lobby doesn&#39;t seem to understand this point.  If people
are intent on committing a crime, they will do it with whatever means
are available to them.  
------------------------

This is an interesting notion -- and one I&#39;m scared of. In my
case I&#39;m a Finnish citizen, I live in USA, and I have to conform
to the US laws. However, the Finnish government is not actively
checking out what I&#39;m doing in this country, in other words checking
out if I conform to the Finnish laws.

However, Islamic law seems to be a &#39;curse&#39; that is following you
everywhere in the world. Shades of 1984, eh?

I disagree with these.  What society thinks should be irrelevant.  What the

I suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical
&#34;assault weapon&#34;.  You are wrong.  Compared to what most criminals use, a
9mm with military ammo (FMJs), or a military rifle (use is extremely
rare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (FMJs), the .32 H&amp;R magnum with
&#34;civie&#34; bullets is more lethal.  Most of the arms which criminals (and
the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.

FMGs.
particularly

FMGs who are not citizens are, like all aliens, in a difficult
situation. Only citizens get to vote here, so non-citizens are of
little or no interest to legislators. Also, the non-citizen may well
be in the middle of processing for resident alien status. There is a
stron sense that rocking the boat (eg. suing a residency program)
will delay the granting of that status, perhaps for ever.

Topic 1:
time question book years did like don space answer just
It would be nice to think that individuals can somehow &#39;beat the system&#39;
and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and
return with a prize cure. Unfortunately, too often the prize is limited
and the efficacy of the &#39;cure&#39; questionable when applied to all
sufferers.

This applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals.
Just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use
does not make the next cure-all. What about the dozens of individuals
who have courageously participated in clinical trials? Did they have any
guarentee of cures? Are they any less because they didn&#39;t trumpet their
story all over the world?

As a parting note, wasn&#39;t there some studies done on Gingko seeds for
Meniere&#39;s? (To the original poster : what about trying for a trial of
that? It&#39;s probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate
some of the discomfort. And you&#39;d be helping answer the question for
future sufferers.)

James Sledd asks:

 1. What is the nature of eternal life?
 2. How can we as mortals locked into space-time conceive of it?
 2a. If the best we can do is metaphor/analogy, then what is the
 best metaphor?

C S Lewis&#39;s essay THE WEIGHT OF GLORY deals with this question. I
recommend it enthusiastically. You might also read the chapter on
&#34;Heaven&#34; in his book THE PROBLEM OF PAIN. He gives a fictional
treatment in his book THE GREAT DIVORCE. I have found all of these
very helpful.

You might also be helped by the treatment in Dante&#39;s DIVINE COMEDY.
Heaven occupies the last third of the poem, but I cannot imagine
reading it other than from the beginning. I urge you to use the
translation by Dorothy L Sayers, available from Penguin Paperbacks.
------------------------
Getting back to the original question in this thread:

I experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those
described.  In my case, it turned out that I was developing Type I
diabetes.  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from my
doctor, I think that the breathing problem was associated with the
presence of ketones due to the diabetes.

I think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting
their food intake drastically.  I don&#39;t know if this relevant in this
case, but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating
properly.
------------------------
From my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature,  I think that the
benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to
other kinds of risks.  (This type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan
grilling.)  One possible remedy I have read about is to take some vitamin C with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  This MAY make sense because vit. C
is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the 
chemicals in question.  Bon Apetit!

For those of you interested, I just finished talking with a 
representative of Senator Bob Krueger&#39;s reelection campaign about his 
position on the RTKBA.  Krueger was appointed by the  Democratic Governor 
of Texas to complete Lloyd Bentsen&#39;s unexpired term.

The representative said that Senator Krueger did not have a position and 
would only comment on specific legislation that was pending.  No comment 
was available on the various versions of the Brady Bill.

Can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic is
dangerous, i.e. indicates a possible pancreatic problem?  One Dr. says no, the
other (not his specialty) says the first is negligent and that another blood
test should be done.  Also, what is a good diet (what has worked) for a hypo-
glycemic?  TIA.

I ordered an Intrepid ES on Jan 25th and haven&#39;t seen it yet.  I called

A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive
pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to
fall every month. But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the 
ovule. Is it true ? If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine
pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian
tube ?

Topic 3:
key chip keys clipper encryption number des algorithm use bit
As of yet, there has been no description of the general principles
behind the Clipper proposal. For example, is this a public key system
or a private key system? If the latter, then I don&#39;t see how the
system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and
not the person).

Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks.
I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks
and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic.
I&#39;m not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system,
but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by 
giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the 
real 80-bit key.
------------------------


The description of the chip&#39;s operation evidently leaves out some of the
key management aspects.  Either the K_P is the secret key corresponding
to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the
result of a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or something similar.  Either
way there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  It isn&#39;t
clear whether they are implemented in the Clipper wiretap chip or must
be provided by other system components.
------------------------
The system, or &#39;family&#39;, key would appear to be cryptographically
useless, since *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its
effects from the bitstream.  I daresay that it will be widely known
almost immediately after this system is deployed, and since it&#39;s been
pointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key -- the same key
is used for both encryption and decryption -- there goes any benefit
to the use of a system-wide key in SkipJack.
------------------------
The only way to view this method of generating unit keys is as a back-door.
What else can you call a key deterministically generated from the serial
number?


 To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is
   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.
   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a
   64-bit block R1:

	   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and
   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  

	   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] 
	   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .

   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The
   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The
   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2
   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow
   agencies.

------------------------


I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m as willing to speculate as anyone.

Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.
Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other
algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on
a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something
like DES) for the encryption.

How could the &#34;back door&#34; keys work in this system?  I can see a few
possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that
the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door
keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers
used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.

Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips
simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip&#39;s own
internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys
usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip&#39;s
secret key doesn&#39;t need to be a public key in this usage, but can be
identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most
straightforward to me.)

Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the
message itself has a &#34;dual key&#34; property, that possession of either of
two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from
the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.

It&#39;s worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised
during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and
December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would
participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn&#39;t quite fit into
what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early
knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with
Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.
------------------------
My thoughts on why the algorithm is secret :

   The chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard.   There will
   be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this
   chip, like it or not.

   If the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the 
   access to escrowed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort 
   would make &#34;compatible crypto chips for which no key had been
   escrowed&#34;.  This is likely what the release was refering to when 
   they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the
   security of the escrow system.
------------------------


It depends on the algorithm used. 128-bit secret keys for RSA are
definitively not secure enough.

Vesselin
------------------------

     In previous postings by Hellman, Bellovin, etal it was
reported the Big Brother (Clipper) chip will encrypt plaintext in
64 bit blocks as is done with DES.  The users key K which can be
derived from RSA, Diffy-Hellman, etc. is used to encrypt
plaintext M and is then used to form a &#34;three part message&#34;.
     This three part message consists of E[M; K], K encrypted
with some other key, and the chip serial number.  This three part
message is then encrypted by still another key.
     My question is: What is a message?
     For example, say we are dealing with an encrypted digitized
voice application.  The speech waveform is sampled and digitized
and then some number of samples are grouped into a 64 bit block.
This block is then encrypted and transmitted over a non-secure
communications link.
     Where is the three part message?  Is something appended to
each 64 bit block?  Is a header sent at the beginning of the
session?
     If the header is sent at the beginning of the session, how
do they insure the equipment manufacturer using the chip does
just that?  Can just anyone manufacture products using the chip?
Is a facility clearance required to manufacture?
     Any ideas?

------------------------
:Thousands?  Tens of thousands?  Do some arithmetic, please...  Skipjack
:has 2^80 possible keys.

We don&#39;t yet know if all 80 bits count.  Anyway, its looking like the
keys and escrow arrangements are smoke and mirrors to cover the way the NSA
can regenerate the key from the transmitted serial number.
------------------------

Once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to 
phsyical inspection and observation.  Now, I will grant that there will no 
doubt be safeguards against &#34;peeling&#34; the chip, but the NSA has no monopoly 
on cleverness.  The chip, and the algorithms it uses, will not remain secret 
for very long.  Any university with a VLSI lab has the required equipment, as 
does any offshore semiconductor manufacturer.

------------------------
From article &lt;1qvjh9INNh4l@hp-col.col.hp.com&gt;, by dduff@col.hp.com (Dave Duff):

   Brilliant I like it!
------------------------
Due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts.

This is a uuencoded bitmap.  960X600 256 colors.
The picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background.
The size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture. Reguarding image
quality and resolution - I have not seen much better.

For those of you who haven&#39;t worked with pieced image files, here
is how to put it back together.
	1. save the 14 parts to 14 individual files
	2. use a text editor to remove the header and footer
	   in each file.
	3. concatinate all the parts into a single file
	4. uudecode the file
There are tools available to do this without the hassle such as
uuconvert (UNIX) and UUcoder (Windows).  If neccesary I could post
these tools or where to get them by FTP -- let me know.

Topic 5:
use does window problem way used point different case value
(2nd posting of the question that just doesn&#39;t seem to get answered)

Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains
Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() 
(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
&#34;regular&#34; expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a &#34;proper&#34; way
to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow &#34;tickle&#34; the
Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.
------------------------
I am using the GLX widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model
application, under 4Dwm, but when the dialog gets popped up, its
text entry field does not have focus. Aimilar code works perfectly if
I use &#34;pure X&#34; (no mixed-model). HEre is the relevant portion of
the code.

{
   int n;
   Arg wargs[16];
   Widget Button, PopUpShell, Dialog;

   /* initialize TopLevel here */
   .
   .
   .

   n = 0;
   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNlabel, &#34;Foo&#34;); n++;
   Button = XtCreateManagedWidget(&#34;FooBtn&#34;, commandWidgetClass,
                                  TopLevel, wargs, n);

   PopUpShell = XtCreatePopupShell(&#34;PupShell&#34;, overrideShellWidgetClass,
                                   Button, NULL, 0);
   XtAddCallback(PopUpShell, XtNcallback, MyPopUp, (XtPointer)PopUpShell);

   n = 0;
   XtSetArg(wargs[n], XtNvalue, &#34;&#34;); n++;
   Dialog = XtCreateManagedWidget(&#34;TheDialog&#34;, dialogWidgetClass,
                                  PopUpShell, wargs, n);

   .
   .
   .
}

void MyPopUp(w, popup_shell, call_data)
Widget w;
Widget popup_shell;
XtPointer call_data;
{
   XtPopup(popup_shell, XtGrabExclusive);
}

---

A way I found to give focus to the text field is to move the
application window around a little bit and place it right behind the popup.
------------------------


As I&#39;ve said before, there&#39;s no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration.  If your window has been reparented, you
can&#39;t assume that the window you&#39;re parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration.  There may be several
layers of windows.  Doing multiple XQueryTree&#39;s until you get to the
root will work in most cases, but there&#39;s no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

------------------------

It depends on the cause of the pneumonia.  For treating bacterial
pneumonia in young otherwise-healthy non-smokers, erythromycin
is usually considered the antibiotic of choice, since it covers
the two most-common pathogens: strep pneumoniae and mycoplasma
pneumoniae.
------------------------


Try this:

char *name=NULL;
unsigned long value;

if(XGetFontProperty(font, XA_FONT, value)) 
    name=XGetAtomName(dpy, value);

where dpy is your Display connection and font your XFontStruct pointer.

------------------------

Actually, I was simply relaying the reasoning of this so-called genius BW
writer.  I agree.  The reasoning was foolish.  

Next time, before you say something foolish, be aware what you are responding
to.
------------------------
Window placement on screen
--------------------------

I would like to configure my system (a HP UNIX) to avoid that any corner
of a given window is displayed outside of the visible screen. The whole
window should be visible and it should be impossible to move any window
outside the visible aerea.

1. Can this be done by configuring the window manager&#39;s resources

2. Can this be done on applikation level 

3. A hardcoded solution is possible, but is it possible to have a
  upper limit of a given window size

------------------------

I specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
came from a simple &#34;open-draw-quit&#34; client.  

As per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
then call the &#34;window_redraw()&#34; (or whatever) directly?  Although, depending
on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with
rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle aches/back aches that
combine aspirin with a diuretic. The idea seems to be to reduce
inflammation by getting rid of fluid. Does this actually work?

Topic 6:
windows thanks know help db does dos problem like using
Hello,

I have a 386sx25 notebook with windows 3.1 running fine. WINWORD 2.0 and 
QUATTRO-PRO for windows also work fine when no virtual memory is used. 
Switching on the virtual memory option these programs (probably others too) 
don&#39;t work, the system crashes. The same programs work well with arbitrary 
virtual memory on two other desktop PC&#39;s. What am I doing wrong?

If you can help, please mail to me directly, if possible.

Thank you very much in advance.

Ok, here&#39;s a nice easy question for all you out there.

When running DOS 5.0 under Windows 3.0, I lose the ability to do a
print-screen.
I have no problem with this when I&#39;m running DOS not under Windows.
If it&#39;s relavant, I&#39;m using &#39;Quarterdeck 6.0&#39; expanded memory manager for
my 386.
  Please e-mail any responses, since I don&#39;t get to read the news too often.
    Thanks in advance.

Anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the Diamond 1024x768x256 driver?
Sorry, don&#39;t know the version of the driver (no indication in the menus) but it&#39;s a recently

if anyone else had seen this.

I have a question regarding sending a NULL character across ethernet
connection. The actual problem is that emacs (Unix editior) needs
the NULL character for setting a mark and unfortunately we don&#39;t know
how to sent that from IBM PCs across ethernet. I am wondering if anyboy
knows the keyboard combination for sending the NULL character. 
BTW control,shift 2 which Ctrl @ does not work.

Thanks

Hiya all,
	
	I realise this has little to do with pc&#39;s but it does have a lot to do
	with hardware....

	So, has nay of you heard of a computer called the Connection Machine.
	If so, could you e-mail me any and all info you have,
	eg- references, ideas etc.

	All help is appreciated.

I&#39;ve just managed to get xdm running from an NCR 3000 (an SVR4 486 box
running XFree86 1.2) to my NCD XDisplay.  It&#39;s pretty much working, but
I&#39;m encountering a weird error.  I&#39;m attempting to start an xterm from
my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  Redirecting stderr to a file
using &#39;exec 2&gt;$HOME/.xerrors&#39; in .xsession reveals the error message:

  &#34;xterm: Error 14, errno 1: Not owner&#34;

Now, if I start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line,
it works fine.  And starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm),
and a clock, from my .xsession also works.

Anyone encountered this?  Suggestions?

Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELP.EXE file?

I have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran
Norton AntiVirus for WINDOWS.  It indicated a possible unknown
virus in the WINHELP.EXE file in both the MWINDOWS and WINOS2
directories.  Neither file changed since I installed my OS/2
system in January as far as I know.

Any information about this possible virus and suggestions on
remedies would be greatly appreciated.

&#39;lo all,

  I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration.
It&#39;s going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
network.  (Actually, it already is running, it&#39;s just not getting all
the info I want it to yet...)  Anyway, I want to check for a mouse.  I
already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft&#39;s Mouse
book).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs, or that they ever load the driver.

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
do I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it.

  Thanks in advance,

Andy

Topic 7:
bike water effect road design media dod paper like turn
I&#39;m looking for brief information on new
applications of electronics (or new electronics in
applications.) If you know of any interesting new
stuff, I would be intrested in hearing about it.
------------------------

A Sea Doo is a boat. It turns by changing the angle of the duct behind the
propeller. A waterski bike looks like a motorcycle but has a ski where each
wheel should be. Its handlebars are connected through a familiar looking
steering head to the front ski. It handles like a motorcycle.
------------------------

OK, as one last attempt, I&#39;ll take a different tack.

We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,
is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to
design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
us who have bikes are familiar.

Let&#39;s look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
own, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to
get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
to transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to
remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
same way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along 
a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
surfaces to something that won&#39;t transmit forces through the contact 
patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It 
probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
but we wouldn&#39;t get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
because, without the contact patches, we can&#39;t turn.  Maybe there&#39;s a 
better way. Besides, even ice doesn&#39;t get rid of the contact patch
forces altogether, so we&#39;d have to find a really frictionless surface.
You&#39;d have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
was the rotation that did it.

Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we&#39;re just looking
for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don&#39;t know of any snow-ski
or skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged
like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I&#39;d love to try
one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike&#39;s,
a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
countersteering.

Conclusion: you don&#39;t need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don&#39;t know what
real effect the gyroscopes have when they&#39;re there, but from my observations
of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I&#39;m 
willing to bet that they&#39;re not the dominant factor in countersteering. 

If you don&#39;t like this conclusion, then don&#39;t accept it, but my motorcycle&#39;s
behaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.

	The girl&#39;s OK, actually, and she recovered well enough to go home.  I
don&#39;t know if she has any permanent damage, though.  Just in case anybody was
concerned...


	If people start forcing others to take responsibility for their actions
things like this wouldn&#39;t happen.  Untill we stop blaming outside causes, and
start blaming the criminals, we will continue to let things like this happen.

I&#39;ve seen them in surplus stores.  All they are are fluorescent bulbs 
without the phosphor, and a UV transparent bulb (special glass).  I&#39;ve
also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120VAC
socket, probably not what you want.


As far as I know, near UV (as opposed to far-UV) is longwave UV (near
the visible spectrum).  Longwave UV is safer as far as accidental (I hope)
exposure to the eyes.  As far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a
friend has a UV lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long UV.

Hope this helps.

Geez.  Everyone comes up with Clark, Williams, Thompson.  These guys
were all up in 1987.  That&#39;s ancient history.  So in the last 6 years,
noone, right?  Beck doesn&#39;t count.  I said 2 solid years.


Let&#39;s see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch.
As I remember, even Bob Brenly had a good throwout percentage under
Roger Craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown
out.  Of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too.

Kind of changed my opinion a bit.  They didn&#39;t seem so menacing after

I got a male Mallard duck in the chest once.

It was like being kicked by my karate instructor.

No accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and I was wheezing
so loudly, that it&#39;s quite remarkable that I was able to come
to a stop with the rubber side up.

The duck, BTW, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.

The bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
my belly button.

	In a not so subtle way they are preparing their audience for the

	their viewers with all their commercials and their &#34;we are ready
	for anything so watch US&#34; messages...

	There SHOULD be a connection of the GROUND wire to a ground
in the breaker box.  There also should be a connection of the NEUTRAL
wire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no other 
place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in
any of the outlet boxes).

	The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a &#39;grounding conductor&#39; for
the plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)
wire is a &#39;protective ground&#39; and carries no current unless
some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It&#39;s safe
to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the 
grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding
conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground
potential as its breaker-box end).

I have a program produces a continuous tone by calling XBell
repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. If it is
run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the X
server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program
have exited. Is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by
emptying the X server bell buffer when each program exits?

This notice will be posted weekly in sci.space, sci.astro, and
sci.space.shuttle.

    The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list for sci.space and sci.astro is
posted approximately monthly. It also covers many questions that come up on
sci.space.shuttle (for shuttle launch dates, see below).

    The FAQ is posted with a long expiration date, so a copy may be in your
news spool directory (look at old articles in sci.space). If not, here are
two ways to get a copy without waiting for the next posting:

    (1) If your machine is on the Internet, it can be obtained by anonymous
FTP from the SPACE archive at ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) in directory
pub/SPACE/FAQ.

    (2) Otherwise, send email to &#39;archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov&#39;
containing the single line:

help

    The archive server will return directions on how to use it. To get an
index of files in the FAQ directory, send email containing the lines:

send space FAQ/Index
send space FAQ/faq1

    Use these files as a guide to which other files to retrieve to answer
your questions.

    Shuttle launch dates are posted by Ken Hollis periodically in
sci.space.shuttle. A copy of his manifest is now available in the Ames
archive in pub/SPACE/FAQ/manifest and may be requested from the email

Note:     The following was released by the White House today in
          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip
          encryption technology.

                           FACT SHEET

                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT

The President has approved a directive on &#34;Public Encryption
Management.&#34;  The directive provides for the following:

Advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption
are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. 
Encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of
communications and data by preventing unauthorized access. 
Advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to
rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. 
These advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the
information age.

Despite its benefits, new communications technology can also
frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated
encryption can have this effect in the United States.  When
exported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
activities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has
been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law
enforcement and national security interests, while at the same time
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As
encryption technology improves, doing so will require new,
innovative approaches.

In the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has
developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through
encryption that is substantially more robust than the current
government standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed
to unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys
will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information
only with appropriate legal authorization.

To assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect
and decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted
information, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:

INSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS

The Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,
shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
incorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed
key-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law
enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from
the American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow
microcircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications
hardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the
security of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do
not intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the
government from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that
are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-
escrow system.

KEY-ESCROW

The Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits
installed in communications equipment.  In each case, the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established their authority to
acquire the content of those communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney
General shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications.

PROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES

The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate
U.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive.

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A &#34;key-escrow&#34; system will be established to ensure that the
&#34;Clipper Chip&#34; is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


&#34;keys,&#34; numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two &#34;key-escrow&#34; data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption&#39;s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal
          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION&#39;S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34;?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; into their devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, &#34;since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright&#34; (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that &#34;every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product.&#34;  There is a
     false &#34;tension&#34; created in the assessment that this issue is
     an &#34;either-or&#34; proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the &#34;Clipper
     Chip&#34; and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration&#39;s policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans&#39;
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?
------------------------
It looks like Dorothy Denning&#39;s wrong-headed ideas have gotten to the
Administration even sooner than we feared. It&#39;s time to make sure they
hear the other side of the story, and hear it loudly!

                         THE WHITE HOUSE

                  Office of the Press Secretary

_________________________________________________________________

For Immediate Release                           April 16, 1993


                STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARY


The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
enforcement.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our
private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the
tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of
protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate
the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and
law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against
industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.

Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to
protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to
protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption
technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the
unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used
by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.

A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; has
been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

This new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. 

A &#34;key-escrow&#34; system will be established to ensure that the
&#34;Clipper Chip&#34; is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding
Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique


                                2


&#34;keys,&#34; numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the
device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately
in two &#34;key-escrow&#34; data bases that will be established by the
Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

The &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; technology provides law enforcement with no
new authorities to access the content of the private
conversations of Americans.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the
Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new
devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the
government will be offered access to the confidential details of
the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
their findings.

The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of
encryption&#39;s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the
privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield
criminals and terrorists.  We need the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; and other
approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access
to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it
to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology
trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),
the President has directed government agencies to develop a
comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:

     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to
          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;

     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone
          calls and data, under proper court or other legal
          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;

     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern
          technology to build the National Information
          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and
          the competitiveness of American industry in the global
          marketplace; and 

     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export
          high technology products.

The President has directed early and frequent consultations with
affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the
privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.



                                3

The Administration is committed to working with the private
sector to spur the development of a National Information
Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer
technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to
information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks
(&#34;information superhighways&#34;) will transmit video, images, HDTV
programming, and huge data files as easily as today&#39;s telephone
system transmits voice.

Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important
role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act
quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding
its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that
protect all Americans&#39; right to privacy while also protecting
them from those who break the law.

Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. 
The provisions of the President&#39;s directive to acquire the new
encryption technology are also available.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION&#39;S
TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE




Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government
     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?

A:   No.  &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; technology provides law enforcement with
     no new authorities to access the content of the private
     conversations of Americans.

Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation
     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to
     decipher the message?

A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a
     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They
     would then present documentation of this authorization to
     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and
     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug
     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are
     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key
     escrow system.

Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?

A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent
     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the
     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will
     oversee the key-escrow data banks.

Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure
     how strong the security is?  

A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption
     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will
     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow
     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of
     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all
     potential users that there are no unrecognized
     vulnerabilities.

Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?

A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the
     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in
     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the
     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet
     officials.

Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?

A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on
     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have
     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the
     decisions related to this initiative.

Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?

A:   The government designed and developed the key access
     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the
     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product
     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip
     manufacturer that produces them.

Q:   Who provides the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34;?

A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,
     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device
     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed
     to other vendors in the future.

Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? 

A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating
     the &#34;Clipper Chip&#34; into their devices.
     
Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological
     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be
     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
     powerful encryption devices?

A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be
     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow
     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product
     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive
     than others readily available today, but it is just one
     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to
     encryption technology, which the Administration is
     developing.

     The Administration is not saying, &#34;since encryption
     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
     we will prohibit it outright&#34; (as some countries have
     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that &#34;every
     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
     unbreakable commercial encryption product.&#34;  There is a
     false &#34;tension&#34; created in the assessment that this issue is
     an &#34;either-or&#34; proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,
     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
     balanced approach such as is proposed with the &#34;Clipper
     Chip&#34; and similar encryption techniques.

Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton
     Administration&#39;s policy toward encryption will differ from
     that of the Bush Administration?  

A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption
     technology in telecommunications and computing and are
     committed to working with industry and public-interest
     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans&#39;
     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law
     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime
     and terrorism.

Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use
     the government hardware?

A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control
     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is
     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The
     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the
     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give
     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this
     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these
     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan
     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability
     of these products.

Hi,

My name is rahul and I am doing MS at USU, Logan
My query is:
	I have a HP workstation: HP Series 400 with X running on it.
I have a true color - 24bit color monitor connected to this machine.
Normally I have the capability to display 256 colors from a max of
16.7 million. Since the monitor is True Color I can see 16.7
million at a time. 
Que: do we have a facility in X(c-function call) that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen? I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of 256 colors.
Que: If not. Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls?

We are generating ray traced images and 256 colors are indeed a
painful limit. besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification.
Please, if anyone can help i&#39;d be obliged

Some VESA bios&#39;s support this mode (0x100).  And *any* VGA should be able to

In evolution of 80-x86 data path width has been doubled from

Thanks in advance for the input.
Robert. 

------------------------


Well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3MHz bus, 16 bits
wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3M
bytes/sec.  Someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5MB/s,
which is the commonly-used figure for ISA bus speed.  However, I
believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

Topic 14:
drive scsi disk mac hard apple drives controller software port
Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART&#39;s built in
(rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?

My current I/O card uses 8250&#39;s (correct number? The braindead ones anyway).
It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.

Ideally, I&#39;d like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with
16550&#39;s and could also control another 2 IDE HD&#39;s. It would have to have
configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so
it could co-exist with my existing card.

Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,
preferably Brisbane?
------------------------

I would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. XT drives
usually came in MFM or RLL flavors. I bet your 386SX has IDE drives. The
two are not compatible on the same controller. However, you might be
able to use the drive *with its controller* in your 386SX. You should be
able to plug your 360K drive into your existing 386SX controller (I
think). You might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
XT.
------------------------
I own a Mac IIsi and am considering upgrades (cards, hard drive, etc).
Can you tell me what the power limitations are for 1) the PDS slot
and 2) the hard drive power feed. Secondly, Can you tell me if there
is a separate limit for each, or if instead, there is a single limit
for both combined?
------------------------

  What you need is a hardware router such as EtherRoute/TCP made by
Compatable Systems ($1400).  This will allow you to connect your Localtalk
network (4 Macs) to your Ethernet network (NeXT and Ethernet Mac).  It will
route TCP/IP protocol between the two networks.  Software routers are also
available for less money, but I&#39;m not sure if they work with TCP/IP.
------------------------
I haven&#39;t seen much info about how to add an extra internal disk to a
mac. We would like to try it, and I wonder if someone had some good
advice.

We have a Mac IIcx with the original internal Quantum 40MB hard disk,
and an unusable floppy drive. We also have a new spare Connor 40MB
disk which we would like to use. The idea is to replace the broken
floppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some
problems:

The internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only
connectors for one single hard disk drive.

If I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each
(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?

Is the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?

What about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor
packs from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them
installed in the other disk.

The SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets
ID #1. The old one should have ID #0.

It is no problem for us to remove the floppy drive, as we have an
external floppy that we can use if it won&#39;t boot of the hard disk.

Thank you!

------------------------
you also need to set the correct switch settings on your xt
controller, which can be a pain, since most pc&#39;s don&#39;t come with
proper docs for all hardware contained inside it.

This problem is usually a low +5 Vdc from the power supply, there is an  
adjustment for this on the supply. If the voltage is still unstable or low  
then the culprit is probably a bad rectifier at CR20.

Topic 15:
god jesus people believe christian bible say does life church
A &#34;new Christian&#34; wrote that he was new to the faith and 
learning about it &#34;by reading the Bible, of course&#34;. I am not
at all sure this is the best path to follow.
	While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the 
revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this
revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one
denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian
congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just
reading the Bible.
	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although
I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the
Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are
comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to
read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable
lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really
sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.
	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith
of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital
beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -
the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church
organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the
lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one
hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies
in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.
	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I 
would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the
christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing
the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into
the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading
Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard
Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene&#39;s _Monsignor
Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,
but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,
I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after
reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being
a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in
some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by
the person of Jesus Christ.
------------------------

The answer to both questions is yes.

All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this
claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.

Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a 
contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always
true.  Obviously, if a &#34;truth&#34; is not always &#34;true&#34; then we have a
contradiction in terms.  

Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a
statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this
way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn&#39;t we conclude that the statement,
&#34;There are no absolutes&#34; is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a
contradiction here.

This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming
that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.


So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate
the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover,
evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain
truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation
for mankind&#39;s sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to
believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.


------------------------
: [first post I&#39;ve seen from the ol&#39; Bug-Zoo (BGSU)]
: &gt;     There is no means that i can possibly think of to prove beyond doubt
: &gt;that a god does not exist (but if anyone has one, by all means, tell me
: &gt;what it is).  Therefore, lacking this ability of absolute proof, being an
: &gt;atheist becomes an act of faith in and of itself, and this I cannot accept.
: &gt; I accept nothing on blind faith.

: Invisible Pink Flying Unicorns!  Need I say more?

There is also the question of what is meant by &#34;atheist&#34;.  A familiar
example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows.

The two statements following ARE consistent:

(1) I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks
(2) I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

The two statements following are NOT consistent:

(3) I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks
(4) I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks

Statements (1) and (2) require no faith, they make no presumptions about
the nature of reality.  Statements (3) and (4) require belief.  Many
atheists (myself included) take the following position:

(5) I do not believe that there is a god.
(6) I do not believe that there is not a god.
------------------------


If I don&#39;t think my belief is right and everyone else&#39;s belief is wrong,
then I don&#39;t have a belief. This is simply what belief means. Where does
the authority for a belief come from? Nowhere, for a belief is itself
authoratative. If I produce authority for a belief, where will I find
authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. In short, 
the mind has to start somewhere. (By the way, the majority of Christians,
i.e. Catholics, believe in the authority of the Church, and derive the
authority of the Bible from its acceptance by the Church.)
------------------------

: The Bible says there is a God; if that is true then our atheism is

: there were many gods; if that is true then your monotheism (and our

Jim,

I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at
least) began with Benedikt&#39;s questioning of the historical acuuracy of
the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to
validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,
then virtually nothing is known of the first century.

You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it
speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection
has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of
atheism.
------------------------


I&#39;ll take a try at this...

From the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted
the bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this,
before Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked 
back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know 
Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our
savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray
THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to 
Jesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses
with me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present
ourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.

I don&#39;t understand who this post is directed towards; who are you
trying to convince? By its subject i would assume you are directing
the argument towards people who do not believe that Christ rose
from the dead, but in your &#34;proof,&#34; you use the bible exclusively.

The post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn&#39;t
believe that the bible is an unadulterated truth, and to everyone
else, it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held. As far
as i know, there is no disagreement between christians over
the resurrection of christ.

so my question is: what is the purpose of this post?

------------------------

If I believed in the God of the bible I would be very fearful of making
this statement. Doesn&#39;t it say those who judge will be judged by the
same measure? 


A God who must motivate through fear is not a God worthy of worship.
If the God Jesus spoke of did indeed exist he would not need hell to
convince people to worship him.


It was the myth of hell that made me finally realize that the whole thing
was untrue. If it hadn&#39;t been for hell I would still be a believer today.
The myth of hell made me realize that if there was a God that he was not
the all knowing and all good God he claimed to be. Why should I take such
a being at his word, even if there was evidence for his existance?

------------------------

[ Much deletion.  He is trying to explain the Immaculate Conception
and the Assumption of Mary.]


If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that
Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and
be like gods?  Eating of the tree of life would not take away the
effects of eating of the Tree of Knowledge.  Is there any reason to
assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had
already attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for
saying that this was taken away from them?  To me the wages of sin are
a spiritual death, not necessarily a physical death.  I
can attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience.
I suspect that many others could attest to this as well. 

Peace
Will

If a person gives a well-balanced reasoned argument, Tammy, then all are
happy to discuss it with him.  If he makes astounding claims, which are not
backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them.
If the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not
supportable then people would have simply ignored him.  He did not.  He
claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed.  His argument was for
christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe
him and his message.  I for one will not take things as read.  If you told me
that pink fluffy elephants did the dance of the sugar plum fairy on the dark
side of Jupiter then I would demand evidence!

  The roar at Michigan and Trumbull should be loader than ever this year.  With
Mike Illitch at the head and Ernie Harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats
will bang this summer.  Already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with
Fielder, Tettleton, and Deer I think they can win the division.  No pitching!
Bull!  Gully, Moore, Wells, and Krueger make up a decent staff that will keep
the team into many games.  Then there is Henneman to close it out.  Watch out
Boston, Toronto, and Baltimore - the Motor City Kittys are back.

------------------------
For those Leaf fans who are concerned, the following players are slated for
return on Thursday&#39;s Winnipeg-Toronto game :
    Peter Zezel, John Cullen

  Mark Osborne and Dave Ellett are questionable to return on Thursday.

CENTERS
[...]
[...]

Sanderson will be on Team Canada, but he&#39;d be out of position as a center.
Although he was drafted as a center and played there as a rookie, Sanderson
scored 46 goals this season as a left wing.

ESPN had the Houston Astros @ Chicago Cubs game scheduled for last night on the
west coast. 

Since the game was rained out, they showed the Toronto Maple Leafs at the
Detroit Red Wings game instead.
------------------------
After the marvelous &#34;time-out&#34; call by Chris Webber (which resulted in 
a technical foul, since his team had no time-outs left) perhaps Webber 
will take the place of Bill Buckner as the master of choke.  At least 
this Red Sox fan hopes so.

I personally will never forget Mike Schmidt&#39;s home run against the
Expos in 1980 that decided the NL East.  It was also his career high
48th. 
------------------------
The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs
by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday
afternoon.  It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and
was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young
season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2
John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny
Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.
Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4,
however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In
the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year
to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the
11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when
the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of
position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the
game.
------------------------

Dale Hawerchuk and Troy Murray were both captains of the Jets
when they were traded.  (Murray this year in mid-season, Hawerchuk
a few years ago in the off-season.)

Topic 18:

Not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of Count
Bernadotte, who was _the_ UN negotiator during the 1948 Israeli war of
independence.  He was killed by the Israelis.  Seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked
territorially against the nascent Israel, compared to continued war.

If you did not see with your &#39;eyes&#39; freedom of religion you
must ne at least blind !
2 weeks ago I read the interview of a Turkish journalist in a GReek magazine,
he said nothing about being forbiden to have Turkish press in Greece !
Give as a brake. You call athnic cleansing of apopulation when it doubles?
What do you mean by that ? Anyway in Greece, as in every  country if you want
some property you &#39;inform&#39; the goverment .
Well well well. When Turkish in Area of Komotini elect 1 out of 3
represenatives of this area to GReek parliament, if not freedom what is it?
3 out of 3 ? Maybe there are only Turks living there ....
I cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.
A minority of Greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which
were protected by the Greek police. Photographs of Greek policemen 
preventing Turks from this non brain minority were all over Greek press.

Is this the joke of the month? 

1. Your fascist grandparents exterminated 2.5 million Muslim people
between 1914 and 1920.

2. Your Nazi parents fully participated in the extermination of the
European Jewry during WWII.

3. Your criminal cousins have been slaughtering Muslim women, children
and elderly people in fascist x-Soviet Armenia and Karabag for the last 
four years.

The entire population of x-Soviet Armenia now, as a result of the 
Genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people, are Armenians. 

For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people 
lived on their homeland - the last one hundred under the 
oppressive Soviet and Armenian occupation. The persecutions
culminated in 1914: The Armenian Government planned and carried 
out a Genocide against its Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks 
and Kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their 
homeland. After one thousand years, Turkish and Kurdish lands 
were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government covers up the genocide perpetrated 
by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
against the Muslims by admitting to the crime and making reparations 
to the Turks and Kurds.

Turks and Kurds demand the right to return to their lands, to determine 
their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

During the 78th Anniversary, we come once again reiterate the
unity of the Muslim People, the timelessness of the Turkish
and Kurdish Demands and the desire to pursue the struggle
for that restitution - a struggle that unites all Turks and Kurds.

Today, we appeal to all Turkish and Kurdish people in the United 
States and Canada to participate en masse in the Commemorative 
Events, be they cultural, political or religious.

&#34;In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who
 had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians
 abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of
 these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the
 brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some,
 mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method
 employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after
 crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw.&#34;

Yarn of Cargo of Human Bones [1]

   PARIS, Dec 22, -- Marseilles is excited by a weird story of the arrival in
that port of a ship flying the British flag and named Zan carrying a
mysterious cargo of 400 tons of human bones consigned to manufacturers there.
The bones are said to have been loaded at Mudania on the Sea of Marmora and
to be the remains of the victims of massacres in Asia Minor. In view of the
rumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.

On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,
we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an 
emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.

In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed 
de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a 
genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively
ruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The 
result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen
and plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization
on those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any
vestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today&#39;s Turkish
governmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture
distortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In 
the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies 
shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy 
merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state 
policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a 
crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the 
successful genocide of the Armenians.

Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...
Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of 
Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as 
&#34;rebels&#34;.

Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish population
figures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.

Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims 
Armenians were a &#34;threat&#34;.

In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of 
approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.

Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. The
success of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey&#39;s Kurdish
population.

The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land and
property lost as a result of this genocide.

ARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR


------------------------


Well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
the fascist x-Soviet Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted 
and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because 
of race, religion and national origin?

As in the past in Turkiye, and today in Azerbaijan, for utopic and 
idiotic causes the Armenians brought havoc to their neighbors. A 
short-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda 
and anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious 
for the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their 
neighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely 
within Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to 
x-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is 
the historic homeland and the &#39;cradle&#39; of the artistic and literary 
heritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, 
even lunatic. 

And we still demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their
heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide 
and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian 
political pressure.

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. 

Now what would you do? 

Source: &#39;The Sunday Times,&#39; 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by 
        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)

    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.

    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former
Soviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.
    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more
than 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an
attack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and
feared dead.
    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending
the women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified
refugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:&#34; That&#39;s when
the real  slaughter began,&#34; said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to
survive. &#34;The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.&#34;
    &#34; They were shooting, shooting, shooting&#34;, echoed Rasia Aslanova, who
arrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through
Armenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed
in front of her. Her daughter was still missing.
    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.

    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in
Agdam&#39;s morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the
seven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were
women, one shot through the chest at point blank range.
    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city
which  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and
killing one person.

Are you suggesting that we should forget the cold-blooded genocide of
2.5 million Muslim people by the Armenians between 1914 and 1920? But 
most people aren&#39;t aware that in 1939 Hitler said that he would pattern
his elimination of the Jews based upon what the Armenians did to Turkish
people in 1914.


     &#39;After all, who remembers today the extermination of the Tartars?&#39;
      (Adolf Hitler, August 22, 1939: Ruth W. Rosenbaum (Durusoy), 
          &#34;The Turkish Holocaust - Turk Soykirimi&#34;, p. 213.)


I refer to the Turks and Kurds as history&#39;s forgotten people. It does
not serve our society well when most people are totally unaware of
what happened in 1914 where a vicious society, run by fascist Armenians,
decided to simply use the phoniest of pretexts as an excuse, for wiping 
out a peace-loving, industrious, and very intelligent and productive 
ethnic group. What we have is a demand from the fascist government of
x-Soviet Armenia to redress the wrongs that were done against our
people. And the only way we can do that is if we can catch hold of and 
not lose sight of the historical precedence in this very century. We 
cannot reverse the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to 
keep the memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people because 
of their religion or their race. Which means that I support the claims 
of the Turks and Kurds to return to their lands in x-Soviet Armenia, 
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

------------------------
A judge denied GM&#39;s new trial motion, even though GM says it has two
new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not
from the fire.

	Thoughts?

	It&#39;s kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
to the previous ruling appear.

	Or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed? 
Shouldn&#39;t that be up to a jury?

	And what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
shows proclaiming their obvious bias against GM?  Shouldn&#39;t that be enough for
a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?

	Whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?
------------------------




Just to address this one point, what about the two Katyusha rocket 
attacks made within Lebanon, for which Fatah claimed responsibility.
I didn&#39;t realize that one can use Katyushas while onr is disarmed.
Also, Page 8 of today&#39;s New York Times, Faisal Saleh, a high ranking 
Fatah official, and his 9 month old son were gunned down in Beirut 
by members of Abu Nidal.  There have been 46 assasination attempts 
in 1993 alone in the fued between these two factions, resulting in
11 deaths.
------------------------



	They did the rollout already??!?  I am going to have to pay more
attention to the news.  Are any of the gifs headed for wuarchive??
