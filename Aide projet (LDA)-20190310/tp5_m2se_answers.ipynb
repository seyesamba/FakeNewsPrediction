However, NMF and LDA do not require the same metric for building the term-document matrix. Indeed, since LDA because is a probabilistic graphical model, it makes no sense to use the TF-IDF. Thus, for LDA, we are using the term frequency (using the `CountVectorizer` class) to build the matrix whereas we are using the TF-IDF (using the `TfidfVectorizer` as in the previous section) for NMF. Apply these treatments for the methods accordingly and store the feature name (the 1000 words that are used as columns of the matrices).

      "     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\n",

      "quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\n",
      "needed in other parts of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\n",
      "never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\n",
      "that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\n",
      "be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\n",
      "members to come out.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\n",
      "to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\n",
      "the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\n",
      "the children who were still inside the compound were being abused\n",
      "significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\n",
      "unsafe conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\n",
      "The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\n",
      "given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\n",
      "evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\n",
      "that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\n",
      "convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\n",
      "increase with the passage of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The third question I asked was, has the military been\n",
      "consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\n",
      "that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\n",
      "that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\n",
      "people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\n",
      "of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\n",
      "military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\n",

      "ENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\n",
      "\n",
      "To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\n",
      "telephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\n",
      "we both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\n",

      "CHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\n",
      "\n",
      "All Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\n",
      "Information Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\n",
      "a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\n",

      "  \n",
      "To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\n",

      "\n",

      "first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\n",
      "rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\n",

      "U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\n",
      "disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\n",
      "2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\n",
      "an 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\n",

      "Clipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\n",
      "family key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\n",
      "has been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\n",
      "then sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\n",
      "return (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\n",
      "together to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\n",
      "session key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\n",
      "be accomplished through a special black box decoder.\n",

      "the Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\n",
      "Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\n",
      "exponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for\n",

      "------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know, but I'm as willing to speculate as anyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several people have suggested that the chips use public-key cryptography.\n",
      "Another possibility is to use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, or some other\n",
      "algorithm which has a similar effect.  DH allows both ends to agree on\n",
      "a session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\n",
      "like DES) for the encryption.\n",
      "\n",
      "How could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\n",
      "possibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\n",
      "the session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\n",
      "keys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\n",
      "used in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\n",
      "simply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own\n",
      "internal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\n",
      "usable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's\n",
      "secret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\n",
      "identical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\n",
      "straightforward to me.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Still another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\n",
      "message itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\n",
      "two keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\n",
      "the DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\n",
      "during her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\n",
      "December was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\n",
      "participate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into\n",
      "what we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\n",
      "knowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\n",
      "Clipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.\n",

      "earth:\n",
      "\n",
      "One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact\n",
      "that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was\n",
      "buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\n",
      "resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\n",
      "claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\n",
      "Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\n",
      "Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\n",
      "that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\n",
      "in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\n",
      "interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\n",
      "Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\n",
      "requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\n",
      "are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\n",
      "mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\n",
      "took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\n",
      "allow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n",
      "\n",
      "One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\n",
      "on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\n",
      "did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\n",
      "The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\n",
      "whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\n",
      "theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\n",

      "A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n",

      "For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\n",

      "protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\n",

      "The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\n",
      "centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\n",
      "their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \n",

      "I was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \n",
      "was already outside, I didn't know what they were doing to her. I was left all\n",
      "alone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\n",
      "though I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\n",
      "Lyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\n",
      "I went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \n",
      "But when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \n",
      "I had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \n",
      "ones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \n",
      "that all of that would die with me.\n",

      "we were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\n",
      "you?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\n",
      "I would remember him. That's when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \n",
      "taken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \n",
      "take the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\n",
      "had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \n",
      "started getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \n",
      "The newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor's axe froze in \n",
      "the air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \n",
      "presence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \n",
      "or not. He said, \"Enough, let's go to the third entryway.\" In the third \n",
      "entryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \n",
      "again that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \n",
      "they went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \n",
      "found, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \n",
      "already taken the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four people remained in the room, soldiers who didn't obey their general. They\n",
      "had to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\n",
      "those 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \n",
      "identified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \n",
      "Azerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\n",

      "and nail the door shut, because they'll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \n",
      "That's when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \n",
      "person in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \n",
      "to, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\n",
      "\n",

      "Marina's old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\n",
      "was racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \n",
      "He wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \n",
      "But the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \n",
      "from flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \n",
      "anything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won't leave you here. Would any of the \n",
      "neighbors let you in? They'll be back, they won't calm down, they know you're \n",
      "alive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \n",
      "They said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \n",
      "yourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \n",
      "coarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\n",
      "boys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\n",
      "down to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What's the mat-\n",
      "ter, aren't you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\n",
      "he came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \n",
      "he couldn't hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \n",
      "told him at the neighbors' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\n",
      "good terms with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "We knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \n",
      "opened the door and immediately said, \"I'm an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \n",
      "Let her sit at your place a while. Don't open the door to anyone, no one knows\n",
      "about this, I won't tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\n",
      "have her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \n",
      "had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \n",
      "tears. Even though I was wearing Marina's old fur coat, it's a short one, a \n",
      "half-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \n",
      "is, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don't know anything. I'm afraid \n",
      "to go out of the apartment, now they're so wild that they don't look to see \n",
      "who's Azerbaijani and who's Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \n",
      "neighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don't want to lose my life because of you, \n",
      "or my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\n",
      "apartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\n",
      "earrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \n",
      "still there. When I'm nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \n",
      "touched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\n",
      "to her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went out and didn't know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \n",
      "don't know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \n",
      "end up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \n",
      "apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \n",
      "I had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \n",
      "hidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \n",
      "some broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \n",
      "Then they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \n",
      "think that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\n",
      "broken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \n",
      "there without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \n",
      "could hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that's what saved me. They were \n",
      "burning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\n",
      "picking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father's sport \n",
      "jacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\n",
      "one end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \n",
      "And again I realized I wasn't getting out of there alive, and I started to \n",
      "strangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \n",
      "my mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\n",
      "afterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \n",
      "burned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone's hand was\n",
      "protecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn't know \n",
      "how. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \n",
      "I found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \n",
      "had never been so close to death and couldn't imagine how you could go on \n",
      "living without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \n",
      "thought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda's place or someone is hiding her. \n",
      "I tried to think that Igor wouldn't let them be killed. He served in \n",
      "Afghanistan, he should protect her.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\n",
      "thought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \n",
      "she live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \n",
      "themselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\n",
      "children's footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \n",
      "Another said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \n",
      "job fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \n",
      "all over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \n",
      "have four children, and there are three rooms here, that's just what I need. \n",
      "All these years I've been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \n",
      "\"Neither of you gets it. We'll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \n",
      "that Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\n",
      "place. And they, to my good fortune, didn't set fire to the apartment, and\n",
      "left.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \n",
      "frequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \n",
      "them bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \n",
      "said, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \n",
      "very often.\n",

      "was at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they're not going \n",
      "to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's\n",

      "no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \n",
      "morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\n",
      "home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \n",
      "Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did\n",
      "our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something\n",
      "awful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don't they want Armenians? Well what \n",
      "are they after, if they're already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \n",
      "that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\n",
      "like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \n",
      "cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \n",

      "asked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\n",
      "on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn't know what she\n",
      "was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \n",

      "she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I \n",

      "you out.\" Mamma says, \"You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can \n",
      "see what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \n",
      "ready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \n",
      "table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \n",
      "out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.\n",
      "We turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \n",
      "We cleared the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't \n",
      "see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\n",
      "station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \n",
      ". . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking\n",
      "somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's \n",
      "an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\n",
      "to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \n",
      "buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \n",
      "people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \n",
      "several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\n",
      "that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not \n",
      "killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \n",
      "the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \n",
      "feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \n",
      "general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak\n",
      ". . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\n",
      "If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\n",
      "and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he\n",
      "got up and left or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "I become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our\n",
      "place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \n",
      "runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \n",
      "starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \n",
      "are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \n",
      "shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \n",
      "turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \n",
      "kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop \n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\n",
      "afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \n",
      "windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \n",
      "and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't \n",
      "crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge\n",
      "cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \n",
      "Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \n",
      "tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \n",
      "din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \n",
      "shouting Father's name, \"Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!,\" or\n",
      "something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \n",
      "says, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \n",
      "of our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won't come in there, \n",
      "they'll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We'll tell them \n",
      "that we live alone here.\" I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in \n",
      "the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \n",
      "that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I \n",
      "can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \n",
      "Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\n",
      "Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told \n",
      "her anything or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell\n",
      "right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\n",
      "leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\n",
      "tell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\n",
      "has happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \n",
      "say, \"OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the \n",
      "apartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\n",
      "them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\n",
      "doorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\n",
      "Too bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\n",
      "pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \n",
      "commanding them: \"Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\n",
      "room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \n",
      "undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \n",
      "in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how \n",
      "much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\n",
      "and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The \n",
      "atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \n",
      "themselves who would go first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes\n",
      "in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \n",
      "He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It \n",
      "seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\n",
      "depends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we're done here.\" They are beating\n",
      "Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \n",
      ". . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was\n",
      "out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the \n",
      "window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \n",
      "windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \n",
      "about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong \n",
      "person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that\n",
      "I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \n",
      "which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \n",
      "don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I \n",
      "humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my\n",
      "tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \n",
      ". . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't \n",
      "know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \n",
      "my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \n",
      "something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\n",
      "else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death \n",
      "come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\n",
      "the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \n",
      "happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.\n",
      " \n",
      "I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \n",
      "clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \n",
      "that I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \n",
      "what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can't make \n",
      "sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\n",
      "served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \n",
      "went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \n",
      "courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though \n",
      "he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \n",
      "served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\n",
      "there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \n",
      "brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \n",
      "\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them.\" How do I know who's who \n",
      "and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\n",
      "Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \n",
      "they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \n",
      "said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the\n",
      "Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going \n",
      "to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's \n",
      "hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \n",
      "sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding \n",
      "on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \n",
      "there. So they survived.\n",
      "\n",
      "My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\n",
      "While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \n",
      "up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \n",
      "there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \n",
      "it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the\n",
      "one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \n",
      "knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I'm not going to let you \n",
      "in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings \n",
      "and we'll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I'll stay at your place because of\n",
      "what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \n",
      "moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came \n",
      "back to our place and lay under the bed . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone \n",
      "number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \n",
      "came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \n",
      "simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed\n",
      "between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\n",
      "There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \n",

      "\n",
      "My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our \n",

      "of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \n",
      "passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \n",
      "after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \n",
      "great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\n",
      "what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \n",
      "only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \n",

      "\n",
      "I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\n",

      "and me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't \n",
      "know what to do with the rest.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \n",
      "boss said, \"Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\n",
      "what happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\n",
      "head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \n",
      "examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \n",
      "ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People \n",
      "called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\n",
      "very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \n",
      "\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \n",
      "says, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been\n",
      "doing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \n",
      "with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to\n",
      "have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \n",
      "condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't \n",
      "have the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \n",
      "think of something that yours haven't already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\n",
      "brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \n",
      "own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \n",
      "morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This\n",
      "was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything \n",
      "more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer, \n",
      "nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at \n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\n",
      "pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\n",
      "same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\n",
      "was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \n",
      "your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can \n",
      "better explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \n",
      "themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\n",
      "ward.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \n",
      "clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \n",
      "but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \n",
      "above my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can't believe you put on such a\n",
      "short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \n",
      "ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \n",
      "brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \n",
      "couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\n",
      "that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one \n",
      "had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \n",
      "Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \n",
      "be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \n",
      "Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must \n",
      "have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \n",
      "else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\n",
      "the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \n",
      "and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to\n",
      "the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\n",
      "I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \n",
      "troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \n",
      "a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \n",
      "that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \n",
      "after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't \n",
      "come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \n",
      "I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \n",
      "me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \n",
      "a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \n",
      "other and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \n",
      "see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \n",
      "interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \n",
      "could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \n",
      "who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions, \n",
      "neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \n",
      "happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \n",
      ". . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \n",
      "not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \n",
      "of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\n",
      "with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\n",
      "myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\n",
      "lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \n",
      "lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \n",
      "from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.\n",
      "When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \n",
      "insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \n",
      "There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \n",
      "me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \n",
      "emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's \n",
      "friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic. \n",
      "They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\n",
      "needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\n",
      "breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\n",
      "They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\n",
      "people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\n",
      "bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\n",
      "wasn't cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \n",
      "appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \n",
      "talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \n",
      "demand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It's Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \n",
      "is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \n",
      "\"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same \n",
      "things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you \n",
      "agitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \n",
      "went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \n",
      "out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \n",
      "they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \n",
      "smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \n",
      "had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \n",
      "club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \n",
      "to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \n",
      "someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\n",
      "Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \n",
      "theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it \n",
      "was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \n",
      "took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \n",
      "Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \n",
      "mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \n",
      "right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \n",
      "the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \n",
      "were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \n",
      "any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \n",
      "together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \n",
      "theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \n",
      "the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \n",
      "couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \n",
      "they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\n",
      "theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my \n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren't you an \n",
      "Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani.\" They\n",
      "led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\n",
      "passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\n",
      "not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \n",
      "nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\n",
      "they should have, with their IDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\n",
      "Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't \n",
      "spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\n",
      "they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \n",
      "the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\n",
      "in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \n",
      "the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \n",
      "she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the \n",
      "building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \n",
      "This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \n",
      "already in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \n",
      "families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians\n",
      "or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't \n",
      "see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult \n",
      "now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify \n",
      "the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\n",
      "gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \n",

      "\n",
      "They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \n",
      "had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \n",
      "going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \n",
      "savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \n",
      "what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \n",
      "hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\n",
      "out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they\n",
      "put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \n",
      "the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \n",

      "whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \n",

      "I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \n",

      "that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \n",
      "the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \n",
      "couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and\n",

      "anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \n",
      "myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \n",
      "there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \n",

      "just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \n",
      "she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \n",
      "me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \n",
      "the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where's the girl who was here?\"\n",
      "And he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn't\n",
      "know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\n",
      "comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\n",
      "came to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \n",
      "whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \n",
      "flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \n",
      "standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \n",
      "to get me. Then one of them said, \"There's so much water down there, she \n",
      "probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \n",
      "the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn't know that, and \n",
      "when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't \n",
      "just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \n",
      "didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \n",
      "started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \n",
      "Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \n",
      "who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think \n",
      "that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but \n",
      "they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \n",
      "brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\n",
      "enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?\" That's \n",
      "all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \n",
      "one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \n",
      "standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are\n",
      "you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \n",
      "that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\n",
      "bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \n",
      "one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \n",
      "an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \n",
      "if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \n",
      "to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\n",
      "stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\n",
      "you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\n",
      "That trick didn't work on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \n",
      "that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it\n",
      "had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them, \n",
      "then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \n",

      "they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\n",
      "were many of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \n",
      "into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \n",
      "skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \n",
      "bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \n",
      "and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \n",
      "that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\n",
      "them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \n",
      "bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \n",
      "there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \n",
      "chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \n",
      "about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\n",
      "Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \n",
      "started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\n",
      "the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \n",
      "one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \n",
      "of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \n",
      "fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What's with you, \n",
      "woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\n",
      "She says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \n",
      "was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \n",
      "and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \n",
      "\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \n",
      "brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \n",
      "don't need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \n",
      "man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \n",
      "started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \n",
      "too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't \n",
      "know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\n",
      "though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \n",
      "to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \n",
      "call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \n",
      "evening and all through the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \n",
      "from Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \n",
      "have our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\n",
      "in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\n",
      "we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \n",
      "one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \n",
      "investigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back \n",
      "here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\n",
      "Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \n",
      "Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \n",
      "Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\n",
      "but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \n",
      "neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \n",
      "hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \n",
      "went up to the neighbor's.\n",
      "\n",
      "The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\n",
      "ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \n",
      "landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\n",
      "crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\n",
      "19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \n",
      "into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \n",
      "weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \n",
      "poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \n",
      "some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They're up there, still,\n",
      "up there. Let's go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \n",
      "the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \n",
      "one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \n",
      "shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \n",
      "the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \n",
      "and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that's from some of the \n",
      "furniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \n",
      "him down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and \n",
      "went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\n",
      "Armenians, they had left for another city.\n",
      "\n",
      "The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \n",
      "crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the \n",
      "apartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \n",
      "this apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At\n",
      "first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\n",
      "he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound\n",
      "of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \n",
      "downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \n",
      "other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \n",
      "They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \n",
      "they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\n",
      "Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \n",
      "saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely \n",
      "accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \n",
      "crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\n",
      "able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \n",
      "the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \n",
      "were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\n",
      "share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \n",
      "troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \n",
      "even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \n",
      "genocide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \n",
      "leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \n",
      "orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '\n",
      "pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock \n",
      "in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \n",
      "quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \n",
      "Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \n",
      "about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \n",
      "was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \n",
      "there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\n",
      "taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \n",
      "there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It \n",
      "was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \n",
      "child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\n",
      "to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \n",
      "man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces \n",
      "were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\n",
      "\n",
      "Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \n",
      "happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \n",
      "father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\n",
      "established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \n",
      "happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They\n",
      "even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \n",
      "mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \n",
      "weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \n",
      "troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\n",
      "across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \n",
      "inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \n",
      "soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \n",
      "weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \n",
      "at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \n",
      "office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \n",
      "Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \n",
      "they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \n",
      "came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\n",
      "perhaps they could have come and saved us.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \n",
      "station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \n",
      "fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \n",
      "which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\n",
      "lists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the\n",
      "leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\n",
      "people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \n",
      "suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \n",
      "family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\n",
      "Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\n",
      "have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\n",
      "\n",
      "At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\n",
      "Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\n",
      "possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could \n",
      "happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\n",
      "out for such deeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \n",
      "disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\n",
      "very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \n",
      "were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took \n",
      "part in the pogrom of our building all in all.\n",
      "\n",

      "to make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \n",

      "me, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take \n",
      "the car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \n",

      "they've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \n",

      "o'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\n",

      "I'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \n",
      "don't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see \n",
      "it. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\n",
      "\"look what they're doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \n",
      "were police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \n",
      "on the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \n",
      "throwing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \n",
      "is shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \n",
      "television, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \n",
      "on her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\n",
      "things, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \n",
      "home. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \n",
      "inside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in \n",
      "your building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, \n",
